# # Criminal Case Database

### Problem Statement

Given the current inefficient processes for beginning legal research, this project seeks to create a proof-of-concept on the creation of an Information Retrieval system in the form of a database of Criminal Law Cases which includes statistical summaries, and legal citations to improve on the speed and efficiency of legal research.  

This project will use Natural Language Processing for Named Entity Recognition and to capture the relevant details of each judgment to create a database which can be filtered to provide not only the cases and other relevant cases, but also a statistical summary of the charges proceeded on, the past sentences given, and any other factors such as mitigation or aggravating factors in order to allow faster research which is also more data driven.  

The project will measure success based on an improvement of research time in contrast to a baseline research time of ____.

### Background

Singapore uses the Common Law legal system, where there is an importance of judicial precedents. This means that judges decide cases based on past decisions of the courts. The decisions of higher courts such as the Supreme Court are binding on the lower courts.
Further to past decisions, in Criminal Law, there is a Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code which creates a statutory framework for investigation, trials, and sentencing in Criminal Law Cases.  

The start of legal research tends to be a slow, manual, and inefficient process. Given the facts of the case at hand, the lawyer first analyzes and determines the relevant area of law to start the research.  
According to a survey done by the ALL-SIS Task Force on Identifying Skills and Knowledge for Legal Practice in 2013, more than half the respondents frequently started their legal research by either looking through statutes or through a case law database, while slightly more than a third would frequently start their research through consulting a subject-specific guide.[1]  
In the current state of the industry, this starting point can take a long time as the statutes and subject-specific guides tend to be wordy, and the case law databases contain many judgments which require further inspection to narrow down according to the case at hand.
