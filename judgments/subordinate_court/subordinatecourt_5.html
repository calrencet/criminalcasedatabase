This sentencing framework (“Framework”) assesses the seriousness of the offence by reference to all the offence-specific factors rather than just “principal factual elements”.

Then the sentencing judge would have to establish the starting point within the indicative sentencing range [this refers to steps (a) to (c)]. At the <b>second stage</b>, the sentencing judge would have to consider the offender-specific factors to calibrate the sentence by considering the aggravating and mitigating factors that are personal to the offender. Thereafter, further adjustments have to be made where multiple offences are involved by taking into account the totality principle [this refers to steps (d) to (e)]. The Senior District Judge also stated that considering the legislative intent of the UN-DPRK Regulations, deterrence must be the main sentencing principle for Regulation 5(a) offences as any non-compliance would constitute a serious breach of Singapore’s international obligations and may result in Singapore being sanctioned and its economic reputation and competitiveness being damaged.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the Prosecution’s Submissions dated 17 September 2020, they sought two sets of sentences against each accused based on when the offences were committed because of the amendment to Regulation 5(1) of the UN Act that took effect on 10 March 2014 vide Act 4 of 2014 which enhanced the prescribed maximum fine 5-fold and doubled the maximum imprisonment sentence for individuals and enhanced the maximum fine 10-fold for companies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22      <u>CHY</u>: It was the Prosecution’s position that the custodial threshold was crossed taking into account (i) the substantial value of his trading activities with the DPRK entities, (ii) the fact that he had used three companies to conduct his business in violation of the UN-DPRK Regulations and (iii) the long duration of offending (more than 6 years). In their assessment, the harm caused was slight (but towards to the higher end of the spectrum) and they pegged his culpability at medium level, especially since he was the sole directing mind and will of the three companies. They submitted that based on the harm caused and his culpability, the indicative starting sentence positions in a claim trial situation should be as follows (highlighted in yellow):</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0013_Image/[2021] SGDC 0013_image1.png" style="height:204.589590277778pt;width:354.9556875pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     They argued that taking into account CHY’s aggravating and mitigating factors, the appropriate sentence for the pre-amendment offences is 2 weeks’ imprisonment and for the post-amendment offences, is 3-4 weeks’ imprisonment per charge. For the global sentence, they submitted for one pre-amendment and one post-amendment charge be ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a 6-week imprisonment sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24      <u>SCN</u>: The Prosecution submitted that for SCN, the harm caused was slight since the trade involved luxury items and not military equipment. However, since the DPRK trade caused harm to Singapore’s international reputation and standing, the assessment of the harm caused should be placed at the higher end of the spectrum. As for the culpability level, they submitted that it should be pegged at medium level since the company’s main business was to supply goods to the DPRK and the breaches were committed intentionally. Their starting sentencing position for the pre-amendment charges was $16,667 - $33,333 and for the post-amendment charges it was $166,667 - $333,333.33.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For the pre-amendment charges, they recommended that the appropriate sentence should be a fine of $10,000 per pre-amendment charge since T Specialist International (S) Pte Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “T Specialist”) was fined $20,000 for this category of charges and $100,000 fine per charge for the post-amendment charges since T Specialist was sentenced to a fine of $200,000 for each post-amendment charge. The Prosecution argued that the same pre-post multiplier of 10²² should be applied for the post-amendment charges to ensure consistency but stated that the individual fines imposed should be calibrated downwards considering the distinguishing factors such as the lower volume of trade and fewer transactions. Accordingly, they sought S$10,000 and S$100,000 fines against SCN for their pre- and post-amendment charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26      <u>Sindok</u>: All three charges that were preferred against Sindok were pre-amendment charges. For the same reasons that were provided in relation to the starting sentencing position for SCN’s pre-amendment charges, the Prosecution submitted that the fine imposed should be much lower than that imposed against SCN and T Specialist because of the lower trade value and lower number of transactions. They recommended that a fine of $6000 be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27      <u>Laurich</u>: The singular charge preferred against Laurich was a post-amendment charge. For the same reasons that were provided for the starting sentencing position for SCN’s post-amendment charges, the Prosecution recommended that the appropriate sentence should be $40,000, considering that Laurich only engaged in one transaction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This sentencing approach was subsequently reviewed by the Prosecution and at the further mention, they argued that the Court should adopt the Bifurcated Approach to ensure that the sentences for the three companies have “both a “punitive” and “disgorgement of profits” component since “disgorgement of illicit revenue can be an <em>effective deterrent</em>”. In support of this position, they referred to section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) that empowers the Court to “disgorge gratification accepted by offenders convicted of corruption offences: <em>Leong Wai Kay v Carrefour Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR (R) 78.” Relying on the principle that the disgorgement of illicit revenue can deter potential offenders, in their Further Submissions on Sentence dated 12 October 2020, they submitted the following amended sentencing positions:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="23.02%"/> <col width="76.98%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">SCN </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The fines for post-amendment charges should only be five times (and not ten times) that of the pre-amendment charges. </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Each fine should further incorporate $18,500 per charge to account for the “disgorgement of profits” component. </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Based on this, the proposed sentences were calibrated as follows: </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- S$10,000 + S$18,500 per pre-amendment charge</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- S$50,000 + S$18,500 per post-amendment charge. </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Amended global fine sought: <b>Not less than S$330,000</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sindok</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Starting point for the pre-amendment charge is S$10,000 and to include an additional component to disgorge the profits of $8000.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Amended global fine sought: <b>Not less than S$18,000</b>. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Laurich</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">No change in the sentencing position of <b>not less than S$40,000</b> for the post-amendment charge as this amount is able to incorporate the “disgorgement of profits” component. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">CHY</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">No change in their sentencing position. </p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s Plea in Mitigation </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The four accused were represented by counsel who submitted a joint Defendant’s Written Plea in Mitigation that mainly focused on the background information and mitigating factors that related to CHY. The following mitigating factors were highlighted:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     CHY is a first offender and the publicity about the case had a “powerful effect” on him;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     He is the primary care giver for his aged mother and the sole bread winner in his family consisting his wife and an infant child;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     The criminal proceedings have “drastically” affected his work and family life as his personal and companies’ bank accounts have been frozen, and he has suffered “immense” losses;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     He was not involved in any syndicate and his trade with the DPRK did not affect the financial institutions in Singapore;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_e"></a>(e)     He cooperated in the police investigations and sincerely regrets and feels great remorse. His companies have ceased operations and he “recognises the importance of ensuring that his practices no longer fall on the wrong side of the law again”; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_f"></a>(f)     His early plea of guilt saved public and judicial resources.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In terms of the appropriate sentencing approach, the Defence agreed that general deterrence should be the main sentencing principle “due to the nature of the offence and the purpose of the DPRK Regulations”. They also agreed that the two-stage, five-step sentencing framework as laid down in <b><em>Ye Lin Myint v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24002-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 1005</a> and adopted in <b><em>PP v Ng Kheng Wah &amp; 2 Ors</em></b> should be used in the present case. They agreed with the Prosecution that the harm caused was “low” as the supply of the designated luxury goods “cannot be said to be the worst type of case falling within the prohibition; especially when there is no evidence that the proceeds from the sale of the luxury goods were used, directly or indirectly, to facilitate the DPRK’s nuclear programme. The Defence also argued that CHY was less culpable than Ng Kheng Wah as his offences were committed over a shorter period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In relation to the indicative sentencing range and the starting point, they argued that the sentence imposed on CHY should be much lower than the sentence given to Ng Kheng Wah “given the large disparity in the total value of the designated luxury goods supplied in the Defendant’s case as compared to <b><em>Ng Kheng Wah</em></b>’s case.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     They also submitted that the imposition of custodial sentences was not warranted in this case and that high fines would suffice for both the pre- and post-amendment charges. This position was premised on the fact that the trade “did not directly threaten Singapore’s national security and foreign policy in the manner contemplated by the United States” (making reference to paragraph [66] of the Grounds of Decision for <b><em>PP v Ng Kheng Wah &amp; 2 Ors</em></b>) as it did not involve the export of military parts and nor did the trade involve in the supply of equipment needed for the nuclear development programme or other nuclear-related matters. Basically, it was their position that custodial sentences should not be imposed as they may diminish rather than enhance any general deterrent value.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     They also added that the amendments to section 5(1) of the UN Act in 2014 to enhance the maximum prescribed punishment have no bearing on the question of whether the custodial threshold has crossed in relation to CHY. Referring to the speech by the then Senior Minister of State for Law Ms Indranee Rajah during the Second Reading of the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill on 21 January 2014, they argued that the prescribed punishment was enhanced with a particular focus on the export, sale, supply or shipment of arms to any terrorist or to the provision to any terrorist or technical advice for a specific purpose “to deter terrorism-related offences” and this was done to ensure consistency with the penal provisions under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In relation to the three companies, the Defence submitted that the harm caused by the companies was lower than that caused by T Specialist and therefore, the fines imposed should also be lower than those imposed against T Specialist “given the disparity in the total value of the designated luxury goods supplied by the Defendant’s companies as compared to T Specialist.” In their Further Submissions dated 8 October 2020, they reiterated that the amendments to enhance the prescribed maximum punishment do not warrant any increase in the fines to be imposed on the post-amendment charges for SCN and Laurich. They argued that it would not be appropriate for the Prosecution to seek an automatic increase in the penalties for the post-amendment charges “purely on the basis of the said 2014 Amendments” since the supply and sale of designated luxury items “fall within the lower end of the spectrum of applicable punishments intended by Parliament”. They also disagreed with the Prosecution’s position that it is necessary to apply the Bifurcated Approach in order to disgorge the profits earned by the three accused companies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In nutshell, the Defence submitted for a non-custodial sentence for CHY and appropriate high fines for the companies .</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Court’s Sentencing Approach and Decision </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This appeal concerns the principles that govern the determination of sentences for offences that are committed under the UN Regulations. The wrongdoings committed by CHY and his companies concern the UN Resolutions passed by the United Nations Security Council (the “UNSC”) to sanction and to put pressure on the DPRK’s leadership to curtail its nuclear and related missile programmes. The UNSC-mandated prohibition on the export of designated luxury items was first introduced in 2006 by Resolution 1718<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and this prohibition was subsequently modified and reaffirmed several times. During the period December 2010 to November 2016 when CHY had supplied the designated luxury items to the DPRK through SCN, Sindok and Laurich, the said prohibition was modified once in 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> (Resolution 2094) and reaffirmed twice in 2016 (Resolution 2270 and Resolution 2321).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As these Resolutions were passed pursuant to Part IV of the United Nations Charter, all UN Member States are required to take measures to implement the prohibition. To this end, Singapore enacted the UN-DPRK Regulations to give effect to the sanctions imposed against the DPRK by criminalising the “supply, sell or transfer, directly or indirectly, any designated export item or designated luxury item to any person in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, whether or not the item originated in Singapore”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Therefore, by committing these offences, CHY and the three companies had undermined the overall effectiveness of the UN sanctions regime.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In terms of the appropriate sentencing approach, it was not in dispute that general deterrence should be the main sentencing principle for offences of this nature. Parties agreed that the level of harm caused was “slight” or “low” and the culpability level of the four accused in these series of cases is lower than that of the accused in <b><em>PP v Ng Kheng Wah &amp; 2 Ors</em></b>. The two parties, however, disagreed on (i) whether the custodial threshold has been crossed in relation to CHY, (ii) the effect of the amendments to Section 5 of the UN Act in 2014 on the quantum of the fines to be imposed on SCN, Sindok and Laurich and (iii) whether the court should add an additional quantum to the fines to disgorge the profits that were made from the illegal trade by the three companies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I will proceed to explain the reasons for the sentences that I imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentences imposed against Chong Hock Yen</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In these series of prosecutions, the offences only concerned the supply of general consumer goods like perfumes, cosmetics, musical instruments and watches that were meant to be sold to the general citizenry of the DPRK. Considering the fact that the main objective of the UN sanctions is to pressure the DPRK’s leadership to curtail its nuclear and related missile programmes, it is reasonable to assume that the gravity of the harm caused would be high if the goods, equipment, materials or items supplied may directly or indirectly contribute to the DPRK’s nuclear or ballistic missile programmes. As there was no evidence to suggest that the goods that were supplied or the proceeds of sale from the sale of these goods had in any way facilitated the DPRK’s nuclear weapons programme, I agreed with the parties that the level of harm caused by the offences committed by CHY was “slight” or “low”. In light of this, the main sentencing issue in relation to CHY was whether a high fine would suffice to achieve the appropriate punitive and deterrent effect.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Having considered the facts of this case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the aggravating factors and the level of his culpability pushed this case across the custodial threshold for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42      <em>His violations had a detrimental effect on Singapore’s standing as a UN Member State and its international reputation</em>: In my view, the impact of the violations on Singapore’s reputation and its standing as a UN Member State was a key factor that required the imposition of custodial sentences. Based on the Impact Statement, Singapore Government received three separate requests through the Inter-Ministry Committee on Export Controls (the “IMC-EC”) from the UNSC Panel of Experts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> for information on CHY and SCN. Apart from the considerable time and effort it took to collate the information requested and to prepare the responses over a 3-year period, IMC-EC also had to explain the measures that had been taken by Singapore “to fully implement the relevant provisions of the Security Council resolutions relating to the DPRK”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The violations of the UN Resolutions and the findings of the UNSC Panel of Experts in relation to the trading activities of the Singapore companies with the DPRK was made public to all UN Members when it was published on the UNSC website in 2018. This damaged Singapore’s international standing as it called into question Singapore’s commitment to ensure the full implementation of the relevant UNSCRs. Further, the UNSC Panel of Experts’ investigation findings were widely reported by local and international media, reporting that companies in Singapore have supplied substantial amount of luxury goods to the DPRK; requiring Singapore authorities to publicly reaffirm when approached by the various media outlets that Singapore takes it obligations under the UNSCRs seriously.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Apart from the scrutiny by the UNSC, the Singapore Government have also been questioned on its commitment to uphold its obligations under UN sanctions regime by its international partners. The US Treasury increased its scrutiny on Singapore companies and financial institutions, which potentially can “negatively impact Singapore’s economic reputation and competitiveness.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Basically, the UN Resolutions passed against the DPRK are binding on Singapore as a Member State and any non-compliance by any Singapore-based entities has the potential of seriously damaging Singapore’s international standing and reputation. In this case, the harm was real as the conduct of CHY and his three companies threatened Singapore’s standing as a UN member and its reputation of being “an international financial centre and transportation and logistics hub for legitimate business activities, built upon the rule of law, zero tolerance for corruption, and commitment to stamp out any illicit activities.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Given the strong public interest to deter such violations, I decided that the starting sentencing position must be a custodial sentence for the offences committed by CHY.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46      <em>The long duration of the offending and substantial volume of trade</em>: Based on the Agreed Statement of Facts, CHY and his three companies supplied the banned luxury items to the DPRK over a 6-year period from December 2010 to November 2016. During this period, three UNSC Resolutions were passed in relation to the luxury items ban (R 2094 (2013), R 2270 (2016) and R 2321(2016)). There was also extensive publicity on how the conduct of several missile and nuclear tests by the DPRK had threatened international and regional security. As CHY had continued to supply prohibited goods to the DPRK through his three companies during this period, I agreed with the Prosecution that his culpability was at the medium level.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Further, the total value of the prohibited goods supplied which was in excess of $575,000 and the duration of the offending clearly showed that this was not a small trading operation and it was for this reason that the UNSC Panel of Experts had observed and reported CHY’s trading activities to the IMC-EC.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48      <em>Motive in committing the offences &amp; premeditation:</em> The Agreed Statement of Facts and the Mitigation Plea revealed that CHY had specifically established the companies to trade with the DPRK as he saw an opportunity to make money. He started his trading activities with the DPRK as early as 1989 which expanded after he met Li Ik in 1991 who worked at the Bugsae Shop, a shop selling general consumer merchandise. He incorporated SCN in 2002 to supply consumer goods to Bugsae Shop when it had grown into a big departmental store and a distributor and wholesaler supplying various goods to other shops in the DPRK. At the same time, CHY had used Sindok and Laurich to source for more business opportunities in the DPRK and he had supplied goods to three other entities in the DPRK through these two companies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Although the three companies were set up before the UNSC’s prohibitions, CHY did not cease his trading activities in the DPRK after the Resolutions were passed by the UNSC. In other words, he continued to expand his trading activities even when the trade became illegal as there were profits to be made. In fact, CHY admitted in the Witten Plea in Mitigation that he only ceased his trading activities with the entities in the DPRK in 2015 when his business experienced a “slowdown” that was caused by the “political crisis in the DPRK” and the political tensions between the DPRK, USA, South Korea and Japan and not because the trade was illegal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     This suggested that over the 6-year period, he was totally indifferent to the controls that the international community had imposed on the DPRK and the impact of his violations on Singapore’s obligations as a UN Member and he was motivated primarily by his own person gain.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51      <em>The level of sophistication and the degree of planning to avoid legal scrutiny</em>: There was clear evidence that CHY was aware of the risks and implications of trading with the DPRK as he had taken measures to circumvent the risks and to avoid detection and scrutiny. First, the goods were not supplied directly to the DPRK and arrangements were made to supply the prohibited goods via air shipment through Beijing, China, via sea shipment through Dalian, China or by hand via airport check-in when necessary. Second, payments by the DPRK entities were made to the companies’ bank accounts through front companies incorporated in Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. He had also used Li Hyon as a “contact liaison” to facilitate the supply of luxury goods to the DPRK when it was difficult to contact Li Ik and to transport the goods by hand<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Further, the newspaper report published by the Straits Times on 19 October 2018 that was included in the Prosecution’s Skeletal Submissions on Sentence revealed that CHY had run a low-key operation” to avoid detection. The journalist who visited the registered address for SCN, Sindok and Laurich reported that the names of the companies were not listed on the floor guides and outside the unit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Being the only directing mind and will of the three companies, he must be held solely responsible for enabling the careful and elaborate set-up and planning of the operations to avoid detection and scrutiny by the authorities. More importantly, all the measures taken was a clear indication that CHY must have known that he was engaging in illegal trade.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Therefore, the aggravating factors highlighted above caused his blameworthiness to be high and for this reason, it was clear to me that the custodial threshold was crossed in relation to CHY. As for his mitigating factors, there were only three that were of merit - (i) he is a first offender, (ii) he had cooperated with the authorities and (iii) he had expressed remorse by pleading guilty. Although they were relevant, in my judgment, they were not exceptional or of sufficient weight to displace the strong public interest requiring the imposition of custodial sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As for the length of the custodial sentence for each charge, the Prosecution invited the Court to impose 2-weeks’ imprisonment for the pre-amendment charges and 3-4 weeks’ imprisonment for the post-amendment charges, with a global sentence of at least 6 weeks’ imprisonment. They referred to the sentences passed against Ng Kheng Wah and argued that the proposed sentencing position was “fair and just” as CHY was involved in fewer transactions and the trade volume was lower in comparison. For Ng Kheng Wah, the Senior District Judge had imposed 1 to 2 months’ imprisonment for pre-amendment charges and 3 months’ imprisonment for the post-amendment charges. The Prosecution provided the following table to present a comparison of the parameters which included the fact that CHY had enjoyed total gross profit of about S$122,116.96, in support of their submission that the proposed sentence was “fair and just”:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0013_Image/[2021] SGDC 0013_image2.png" style="height:232.660423611111pt;width:294.74375pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In determining the individual custodial sentences, I agreed with the Prosecution that it is necessary to consider the sentences that were imposed against Ng Kheng Wah to ensure parity in treatment. Having considered the facts in <b><em>PP v Ng Kheng Wah &amp; 2 Ors</em></b>, I found that the aggravating factors in that case were significantly more serious. First, although Ng Kheng Wah had only carried out 36 more trading transactions than CHY and he had used one company to carry out the prohibited trade, his total value of trades was in the region of $6 million – about $5.5 million more the total value of the trades involving CHY. It was probably because of this reason that the UNSC Panel of Experts had mainly focused on T Specialist’s trading activities in their report.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Second, for the charges proceeded with against Ng Kheng Wah, the lowest value of trade in the individual charges was $174,144 and the highest was $318,950.23. Whereas for CHY, the highest value of trade for the individual proceeded charges is $68,400 with the individual value of the trade for the rest of charges being less than $37,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Third, I could not ignore the fact that Ng Kheng Wah’s overall culpability was much higher as he had engaged in serious fraudulent activities in order to facilitate his illegal trading activities with the DPRK entities when he started experiencing payment problems. The facts supporting the cheating and money laundering charges preferred against him revealed that Ng Kheng Wah created and submitted false commercial invoices on 81 occasions to generate liquidity in order to continue supplying the designated luxury goods to the DPRK. A total of five banks were cheated in the process. Ng Kheng Wah’s criminality also involved him instigating the use of round tripping activities to avoid leaving a paper trial that might reveal his fraudulent acts for which another set of false trade documents were created to give the impression that payments were for genuine commercial transactions. The fact that Ng Kheng Wah had committed multiple serious offence domestically to facilitate the violation of the UNSC sanctions regime makes his overall conduct significantly more serious.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Fourth, there was no mention in the Grounds of Decision issued in <b><em>PP v Ng Kheng Wah &amp; 2 Ors</em></b> that Ng Kheng Wah’s had cooperated with the authorities, unlike CHY, who according to the Defence, had been “fully cooperative with the authorities”. It was stated in the Written Plea in Mitigation that he had willingly provided all the relevant documents and was “honest and forthcoming” when he gave his statements to facilitate the investigations. It was the Defence’s submission that the “facts of the case to which our Client had admitted to was largely based on the information he had given to the Investigation Officer” and this was not disputed by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Fifth, even though the offences committed involved illegal transnational trade with transnational implications which would generally aggravate an offence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, I decided that this was a neutral factor in this case. As the legislation made it an offence to supply designated goods to the DPRK, the transnational element is inherent in the said offence and cannot be treated as an aggravating factor when all offences committed under the UN-DPRK Regulations would be transnational in nature. As explained in <b><em>Neo Ah Luan v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22630-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1153</a> at [80], inherent factors should not be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing as an aggravating factor:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">80    In my judgment, in an offence of this nature it would generally be inappropriate for a court to treat the offender’s lack of professional liability insurance as an aggravating factor. To begin with, the law generally does not treat factors which are inherent in an offence as aggravating (<em>Yap Ah Lai v PP</em> <u><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 3 SLR 0180.xml')">[2014] 3 SLR 180</a></u> at [83] and <em>Pittis Stavros v PP</em> <u><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17406-SSP.xml')">[2015] 3 SLR 181</a></u> at [68]). Here, almost inevitably, any person who violates s 13 of the MRA by practising or doing acts as a medical practitioner without proper registration and certification will not be covered by professional liability insurance. In that sense, the lack of professional liability insurance, though not <em>inherent</em> in the offence, is a <em>logical consequence</em> of the offence which would be present in every case. It would, moreover, be duplicative to consider <em>both</em> the risk of injury <em>and</em> the risk that the victim would not be able to recover civil compensation for such injury in assessing the level of potential harm. I therefore do not consider that this is a factor which should be taken into account in sentencing for offences under s 17(1) of the MRA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In addition, I did not agree with the Prosecution that it was necessary to enhance the length of the individual sentences for the post-amendment charges just because the maximum prescribed custodial sentence was doubled from 5 years to 10 years in 2014. While I accept that the increase in the prescribed sentence was a signal by Parliament that the offences under section 5(1) of the UN Act may attract higher sentences and that as the sentencing judge I have to consider the entire range of punishment as provided by the enhanced statutory punishment, I was also acutely aware that I should only impose higher sentences for offences committed after the amendment in 2014 if they were warranted on the facts of the case. As explained by the High Court in <b><em>Pitis Stavros v PP</em></b> [2015 3 SLR 181 at [61 – 62]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">61    In the High Court decision of <em>Ong Chee Eng v PP</em> <u><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0776.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 776</a> </u>at [24], Chao Hick Tin JA had observed that “where Parliament has enacted a range of possible sentences, it is the duty of the court to ensure that the full spectrum is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence”. This was cited with approval by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Poh Boon Kiat v PP</em> <u><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17081-SSP.xml')">[2014] 4 SLR 892</a></u> at <u>[60]</u>. Menon CJ further noted, citing <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP</em> <u><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0653.xml')">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653</a></u> at [86], that the statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence and that the sentencing judge “ought to note the maximum penalty imposed and then apply his mind to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament”.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">62    Since the full range of sentencing options ought to be considered, it would follow that the same criminal conduct could attract a higher sentence where the maximum was seven years’ as compared to three years’ imprisonment. But ultimately whether a higher sentence is warranted must still depend on a careful consideration of the gravity of the offending conduct in each case. In this regard, the following observations of the Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, during the Second Reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill are apposite. He explained that “it does not mean that automatically when the maximum punishment is raised, the punishment will go up”: see the <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (23 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2439. At the Opening of the Legal Year 2008, the Public Prosecutor similarly noted that the Prosecution “will not automatically press for higher sentences merely because the maximum penalties have been increased”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Therefore, it was necessary to ascertain the reason for the increase in the maximum prescribed sentence that had taken effect in 2014. As explained in <b><em>PP v GS Engineering &amp; Construction Corp</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20217-SSP.xml')">[2017] 3 SLR 682</a> at [46 – 49], whether a sentencing court should increase the sentences it intends to impose after a legislative increase to the maximum prescribed punishment would very much depend on “the rationale and intention behind the legislative amendment”:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    In my view, there is in fact little difference between the parties’ respective positions (and the District Judge’s finding). Ultimately, whether the court should correspondingly increase the sentences it imposes when the maximum prescribed punishment for any particular offence is increased is dependent on the rationale and intention behind that legislative amendment.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    The increase in the maximum prescribed punishment may, in some cases, be due to Parliament’s view that the sentences for that offence need to be higher, either because the prevailing benchmarks are too low or because there has been an upward trend or an increased prevalence in that offence. In such cases, the underlying rationale is that the existing maximum prescribed punishment appears to be inadequate and a wider sentencing range with a higher upper limit is warranted. The courts should then take cognisance of such considerations in sentencing. In this connection, Sundaresh Menon CJ made the following observations in <em>Mehra</em> (at [27]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">As a generally operative background factor, if Parliament has increased the punishment for an offence <em>on the basis</em> that the mischief in question was becoming more serious and needed to be arrested … the courts would not be acting in concert with the legislative intent if they fail to have regard to this in developing the appropriate sentencing framework or if they nonetheless err on the side of leniency in sentencing. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">48    In other cases, however, the increase may be for an entirely different reason. Take for instance, the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(<em>a</em>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). In 2008, the maximum determinate imprisonment sentence for this offence was increased from ten years to 20 years. The rationale of this increase was not because Parliament had viewed the offence with increased severity. The amendment was so as to bridge the gulf between the then-maximum determinate punishment of ten years and the term of life imprisonment. It was to accord the courts with a greater range of discretion in calibrating the sentences according to the facts of each case and to deal with the culpability of the offender in a more nuanced fashion (see the observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v Vitria Depsi Wahyuni</em> <u><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0699.xml')">[2013] 1 SLR 699</a></u> at [22]–[23]). Another example of this is the amendment to increase the maximum sentence for an offence of giving false information to a public servant under s 182 of the Penal Code (see <em>Koh Yong Chiah v PP</em> <u><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19675-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 253</a></u> at [20]).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    The District Judge is thus correct in saying that an increase in the punishment prescribed by law does not inexorably or “necessarily” equate to a need for an increase in sentences imposed. In the latter category of cases, no such corresponding increase in sentences is required. The real question is thus whether Parliament, in increasing the maximum penalty for this offence from $200,000 to $500,000 (in relation to companies), intended for higher sentences to be imposed for greater deterrent effect.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     After considering the speech made by the then Senior Minister for Law, Ms Indranee Rajah when the said amendments were tabled, it did not appear to me that the legislative intent was for the Courts to impose significantly higher sentences for <u>all</u> offences that are prosecuted under section 5(1) of the UN Act after the amendment. The speech during the Second Reading of the Bill made it clear that the increased penalties were specifically targeted at the terrorism-related offences under the United Nations Act – The United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Regulations which make it an offence to export, sell, supply or ship arms to any terrorist or to provide any terrorist with technical advice, assistance or training related to military activities. It was explained that the maximum fines for these offences were raised from $100,000 to $500,000 for individuals and to $1 million for entities and the maximum imprisonment term for these offences was raised from five years to 10 years to align the penalties for the terrorism-related offences under the United Nations Act – The United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Regulations to other terrorism-related offences to “ensure consistency across our anti-terrorism legislation.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Based on this, I agreed with the Defence that the amendments may not have a bearing on the determination of the sentences to be passed in this case which involved the supply of consumer goods as the purpose of the increase in the prescribed maximum penalties in 2014 was mainly to eliminate the discrepancy in relation to the sentencing regimes for all terrorism-related offences by enabling the Court to impose equally severe sentences for offences under United Nations Act – The United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Regulations. Therefore, I decided that it would be wrong to assume that Parliament had intended to effect a general increase in the sentences for all types of offences that were punishable under section 5 of the UN Act; especially when the UN Regulations and even the UN-DPRK Regulations cover a whole spectrum of offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Hence, I could not agree with the Prosecution that enhanced sentences should be imposed on the post-amendment charges. I also disagreed with them that the violations committed post-amendment would cause “a higher degree of harm to Singapore’s reputation and international standing”; especially when they were not related to the development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes and when the value of the trades for the post-amendment individual charges was not significantly higher than the value of trades involving the pre-amendment charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     For the reasons stated above, I decided that the sentences proposed by the Prosecution were not “just and fair” and sentenced CHY to 1 week’s imprisonment for all the charges except for the charge DAC 934423/2018 for which I imposed 2 weeks’ imprisonment. The charge DAC 934423/2018 is a post-amendment charge and I imposed a higher sentence not because of the 2104 amendment but because I decided that this charge warranted an upward adjustment because the value of the trade involved was almost double that in the other charges proceeded with.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I ordered two charges to run consecutively and these were DAC 934401/2018 and DAC 934423/2018, giving <u>a global sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment</u>. In my judgment, this global sentence is a just and proportionate reflection of CHY’s overall criminality by abetting the illegal trade as the main directing mind and will of SCN, Sindok and Laurich.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentences imposed against SCN, Sindok and Laurich</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In relation to three entities, SCN, Sindok and Laurich, I disagreed with the sentences proposed by the Prosecution for three main reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_i"></a>(i)     I disagreed with the level of overall culpability attributable to Sindok and Laurich;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     I disagreed with their approach to determine the starting sentencing positions; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     I disagreed with the application of the Bifurcated Approach to incorporate the “disgorgement of profits” component in the fines imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69      <em>Level of culpability attributable to Sindok and Laurich</em>: The Prosecution submitted that for the three companies, the harm caused was “slight” and their overall culpability being at the medium level. They premised their position on the fact that (i) the companies had committed the breaches with knowledge and (ii) the supply of luxury goods to the DPRK was their core business. While I agreed with them that SCN’s culpability was at the same level as CHY’s, I could not agree that the same could be said for Sindok and Laurich. This was because the number of trading transactions that these two companies had engaged in and the duration of their offending was significantly less when compared with SCN.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     According to the Agreed Statement of Facts, Sindok only supplied goods to the DPRK on three occasions and this was over a one-year period from May 2012 to May 2013. Laurich only traded once and this was in October 2015. Correspondingly, the value of the trades of these two companies was markedly lower that of SCN’s. Considering this, I decided that it would be inappropriate to ascribe the same level of culpability to these two companies and that the correct level should be low.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71      <em>Approach to determine the starting sentencing positions for the three companies</em>: The Prosecution put forward a sentencing matrix wherein they proposed that the sentencing range for the pre-amendment charges should be $16,667 to $33,333 and this range should be adjusted upwards to $166,667 - $333,333.33 for the post-amendment charges since the amendments in 2014 increased the maximum prescribed fine ten-fold.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Based on this approach, their initial sentencing approach for <u>SCN</u> was as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     The starting point for sentencing for pre and post-amendment charges was as follows:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0013_Image/[2021] SGDC 0013_image3.png" style="height:205.244576388889pt;width:354.9556875pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a-p2_b"></a>(b)     Taking into account (i) the aggravating factors (which included the gross profits earned by SCN during the period of offending), (ii) the mitigating factors and (iii) the fines imposed against T Specialist to ensure parity ($20,000 for each pre-amendment charge and $200,000 for each post-amendment charge), they proposed that a fine of $10,000 should be imposed on each pre-amendment charge and a fine of $100,000 should be imposed on each post-amendment charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In relation to <u>Sindok</u>, their initial sentencing approach was as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     The starting point for sentencing for the pre-amendment charge should be:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0013_Image/[2021] SGDC 0013_image4.png" style="height:139.418472222222pt;width:354.628194444444pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a-p2_b_1"></a>(b)     Taking into account (i) the aggravating factors (which included the gross profits that Sindok had enjoyed during the period of offending), (ii) the mitigating factors and (iii) the fines imposed against T Specialist ($20,000 for each of the pre-amendment charge), they proposed a fine of $6,000 to be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     For <u>Laurich</u>, their initial sentencing approach was as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     The starting point for sentencing for the singular post-amendment charge should be:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0013_Image/[2021] SGDC 0013_image5.png" style="height:136.938881944444pt;width:354.9556875pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     Taking into account (i) the aggravating factors (which included the gross profits that Laurich had enjoyed from the single transaction), (ii) the mitigating factors and the fines imposed against T Specialist ($200,000 for each post-amendment charge), they proposed that a fine of $40,000 be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     While I was prepared to accept the proposed starting sentencing position for the pre-amendment charges for SCN, I expressed concern over the Prosecution’s approach and sentencing position on the post-amendment charges for SCN and Laurich. This was mainly in relation to their proposal that the fines imposed for the post-amendment charges should be automatically increased ten-fold and that a higher total fine should be imposed on SCN as compared with T Specialist ($420,000 against SCN and $380,000 against T Specialist) even when SCN is significantly less culpable than T Specialist. In response, the Prosecution submitted that a higher total fine was justified since the bulk of SCN’s trading activities took place after the amendment in 2014, during the period when T Specialist was reducing their involvement in this prohibited trade. They argued that this fact pushed SCN’s culpability to a higher level since trading activities after 2014 would cause greater damage to Singapore’s reputation and international standing - “that would naturally increase the---the---the damage that is caused to the sanctions you give and in that sense, it must be higher weight given to this particular fact.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> They further argued that the total sentence imposed on SCN must be higher than that imposed on T Specialist as SCN had enjoyed a gross profit of $111,024.27 while T Specialist suffered massive losses<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> since the sentences passed against SCN should include “some element of disgorgement made as well as punishment”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I also indicated my concern over their proposed sentencing position for Sindok as their proposed fine of $6000 was less than the gross profit earned by Sindok which was $7,887.74. In response, the Prosecution explained that they had determined $6000 to be a fair sentence based on the fine that they had proposed for SCN for their pre-amendment charges since Sindok’s trading value was “two-thirds of SCN”. However, they admitted that this approach was at odds with their submission that fines imposed should incorporate “some element of disgorgement made as well as punishment” and indicated that they would review their position in relation to Sindok as “it is somewhat inconsistent” with their proposed sentencing framework<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The matter was then adjourned for the Prosecution to review their sentencing positions and for the parties to put in further submissions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The Prosecution proceeded to review their overall sentencing approach in relation to SCN, Sindok and Laurich and in their Further Submissions on Sentence, they proposed that it would be sufficient for the fines for the post-amendment charges to be increased five-fold to achieve the deterrent effect. They submitted that these series of cases were “less aggravated than the previous case of T Specialist and Mr Ng Kheng Wah” and therefore, the culpability of SCN, Sindok and Laurich for the post-amendment charges should be pegged at half of that of T Specialist since -</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_i"></a>(i)     these companies collectively have half the number of charges compared to T Specialist; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the collective total value of the trades was significantly lower compared to T Specialist’s – approx. $575,000 vs $6 million over almost the same duration of offending.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In addition, they submitted that the fines imposed should incorporate a component to account for the “disgorgement of profits” enjoyed by SCN, Sindok and Laurich. They explained that this was not done in <b><em>PP v Ng Kheng Wah &amp; 2 Ors</em></b> as there were no profits to disgorge. They proposed that the Court should incorporate the “disgorgement of profits” component “First, by calibrating the punitive part of the fine by taking reference from T Specialist’s sentences, and then pegging on a disgorgement component, in order to give effect to the fact that the companies in the present case did make profits from the offenders.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Under their new sentencing approach for <u>SCN</u>, the Prosecution agreed with the Defence that SCN’s overall culpability caused less harm and that “the importance of deterrence as a sentencing consideration is lower in SCN’s case” since it has fewer charges and the total trade volume is lower. They argued that a five-fold increase would be sufficient and that “the appropriate starting point for each post-amendment charge is $50,000.” Based on this, they proposed the following sentences for SCN:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_a"></a>(a)     a global fine of not less than S$330,000 comprising (i) $10,000 to be imposed on each pre-amendment charge, and (ii) $50,000 to be imposed on each post-amendment charge; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_b"></a>(b)     the total gross profit of $111,024.27 earned by SCN to be factored in the individual fines to disgorge it by splitting it equally to the six charges proceeded with, resulting in an additional quantum of $18,500 being tagged to each charge to represent the disgorgement component.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     They argued that their revised sentencing position in relation to SCN and the proposed total fine of $330,000 is “consistent with the lower harm caused by SCN” and it “carries sufficient deterrent effect”. This was their revised sentencing position:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0013_Image/[2021] SGDC 0013_image6.png" style="height:113.219027777778pt;width:354.9556875pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Similarly, they reviewed their approach in relation to <u>Sindok</u> and proposed that the fine to be imposed should “incorporate a component to account for the “disgorgement of profits”. They also calibrated their proposed sentence upwards and submitted that the total fine should be not less than $18,000, comprising $10,000 as the punitive component and an additional quantum of $8000 representing the disgorgement of profits component (approx. $7887.74 gross profits).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In relation <u>Laurich</u>, they submitted that the initial proposed fine of $40,000 is appropriate applying the five-fold increase approach and it is sufficiently high to “incorporate a component to account for the “disgorgement of profits”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Defence submitted that the amendments in 2014 “do not warrant any increase in the appropriate punishment” since (i) the increase in the maximum prescribed punishment was “to specifically deter terrorism-related offences” and (ii) the supply of designated luxury goods “fall within the lower end of the spectrum of applicable punishment intended by Parliament” whether the offences were committed before or after the amendment. They argued that to determine the “appropriate punishment”, what the Court has to consider are the relevant circumstances to ensure that it is “proportionate to the culpability of the offender and the gravity of the offence, and this is the case even where there has been an increase in the maximum prescribed punishment in the relevant act.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     They also disagreed with the Prosecution’s approach to include an additional quantum to disgorge the profits earned in relation to the three companies, suggesting that the Prosecution has “just adjusted the numbers to roughly try and get the same high kind of figure.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> for SCN and that an appropriate non-bifurcated high fine would be of “sufficient deterrence, given that all three companies have ceased their operations entirely in Singapore and with the DPRK.” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     After considering the further submissions by both parties, I rejected the Prosecution’s proposed approach to increase the fines for the post-amendment charges five-fold and to bifurcate the fines by adding an additional quantum to disgorge the gross profits earned by the companies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86      <em>Why it is not appropriate to apply a 5-fold increase for the post-amendment charges in this case</em>: The Prosecution suggested in their submissions that it is necessary to calibrate the sentences upwards for the offences committed after the 2014 amendment to achieve the deterrent effect intended by Parliament. In the parallel series of prosecutions, they had proposed a ten-fold increase for this purpose and in this case, they argued that a five-fold increase would be sufficient to achieve the deterrent effect as the culpability and the harm caused were less serious in this case. First, I am not certain if it is appropriate as matter of principle to apply these individualised calibrations based on the offender-specific sentencing factors (for e.g.; 10-fold increase for T Specialist and 5-fold increase for SCN and Laurich because of different factors) to achieve the deterrent effect intended by Parliament. This is because if I were to adopt their approach, I would not be able to apply the 5-fold increase for Laurich when I assessed Laurich’s culpability to be at the low level and not medium.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In my view, any approach adopted must achieve the objective of the amendment that enhanced the maximum prescribed sentence under section 5(1) of the UN Act. For reasons stated above in paragraphs 61 to 64, I did not agree with the Prosecution’s position that the “Underlying this ten-fold increase was precisely the greater need for deterrence in relation to post-amendment breaches under Reg 5(a) UN-DPRK reg.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> As explained above, the amendment was made as part of Parliament’s general plan to deter offences that are linked to terrorism-related activities and it was done with the intent to “ensure consistency across our anti-terrorism legislation.” Based on this, I decided that it is not necessary apply a significant uplift (ten -fold or 5-fold) in this case as SCN and Laurich were not involved in the supply of terrorism-related goods or products. However, in determining the sentence, I did apply my mind to the fact that the statutory maximum fine for companies has been increased to $1 million “to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament”: <b><em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP </em></b><em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0653.xml')">[2006] 4 SLR (R) 653</a></em> at [86] to achieve the appropriate deterrent effect.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In this case, I did calibrate the sentences upwards for some of the post-amendment charges because of the longer duration of the offending, the higher value of the trade, the number of violations of the UN Sanctions by the DPRK and the number of new sanctions that were imposed in response to the violations post-amendment. In addition, I took into account the following offender-specific factors:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_a"></a>(a)     all the three companies were first offenders;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_b"></a>(b)     the three companies had cooperated in the investigations and had expressed remorse by pleading guilty; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_c"></a>(c)     the companies have taken steps to prevent further violations by ceasing their operations in Singapore and their trading activities with the DPRK.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Having done so, for SCN, I decided that it would be fair to impose a fine of $15,000 on each of the pre-amendment charges to ensure parity since SCN’s overall culpability caused less harm than T Specialist’s. For the post-amendment charges, I applied a more modest uplift and imposed a fine of $20,000 on three of the charges (DSC 90767/2018 – DSC 900769/2018) as these charges involved a longer duration of offending. For DSC 900765/2018, I doubled the fine to $30,000 after taking into account the fact that the value of the trade for that charge was almost double that of the other charges. In my judgment, the total fine of $120,000 was a fair and proportionate aggregate sentence taking into account the substantial disparity in the level of culpability and harm caused between SCN and T Specialist based on (i) the number of trading transactions (43 vs 79) and (ii) the total value of the trades (approx. $575,000 vs approx. $6 million).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In relation to Sindok, I decided that it would be fair to impose a fine of $10,000 on the pre-amendment charge, to ensure parity with the sentences imposed on SCN and T Specialist since Sindok’s overall culpability caused significantly less harm. In my view, the fine imposed was sufficiently high to achieve the punitive effect and to serve the confiscatory purpose.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As for Laurich, I decided that it would be wholly unfair to impose a fine of $40,000 for the singular post-amendment charge; especially when Laurich’s culpability was significantly lower than the other two companies and T Specialist. Laurich had only committed one offence by supplying musical instruments to MSG Corporation on 16 October 2015 and the value of this trade (USD 12,000) was the lowest among all the charges proceeded with against the three companies. Therefore, based on the profits earned (approx. S$3,204.95), I decided that a fine of $10,000 was sufficiently high to penalise and to disgorge the profits.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92      <em>Why the Prosecution’s “Bifurcated Approach” to incorporate the disgorgement component was not adopted in this case</em>: It is trite law that fines imposed must “serve both purpose to punish the offender and to disgorge any profits which he may have made from committing the offence.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> It was for this reason that I had expressed concern when the Prosecution had proposed a fine for Sindok that was less than the gross profits that the company had earned. The issue that the Prosecution invited me to consider was whether the twin purpose of punishing the offenders and disgorging the profits can only be achieved in this case by using the Bifurcated Approach. I wish to say that I did not have the benefit of the guidance of the decision in <b><em>PP v Su Jiqing Joel</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25215-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 233</a>, wherein Sundaresh Menon CJ ruled that the bifurcated approach should be adopted as a matter of principle in context of the prosecution of a first offender under section 12(1) of the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed) when I sentenced the accused in this case on 12 October 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Having considered the Prosecution’s submissions, I decided that it was not necessary to split the fine imposed into the punitive and disgorgement components in order to achieve the appropriate deterrence for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     The sentencing principle governing section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (the “PCA”) did not support the application of the Bifurcated Approach proposed by the Prosecution as the UN Act did not specifically provide for the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Prosecution did not explain why the imposition of high fines in this case could not disgorge the profits; especially when the maximum prescribed sentence for companies is $100,000 fine for the pre-amendment charges and $1 million fine for the post-amendment charges.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     Unlike in <b><em>PP v Su Jiqing Joel</em></b>, SCN, Sindok and Laurich were prosecuted together with CHY who is the directing mind and will of the companies. As the three companies were in fact the alter ego of CHY in the commission of the offences and his criminal liability is attributable to them, I decided that it may not be necessary to separate the punitive component for the fines imposed to ensure that the companies are sufficiently punished since the punitive objectives of deterrence and retribution for the commission of the offences by CHY and the three companies were mostly achieved through the imposition of the custodial sentences on CHY. In other words, I was inclined to take the view that in a joint prosecution involving corporate offenders and the director who is the directing mind and will through whom the companies had acted, it would be appropriate to consider the overall net deterrence (general and specific) that is to be achieved when determining the punishment to impose on the individual offenders. This is to ensure that the overall punishment for all the accused persons will commensurate with the seriousness of the offences that they had committed together.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Therefore, I decided that it was not necessary to use the Bifurcated Approach to ensure that the three companies were sufficiently punished.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">In Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     For the reasons set out above, I was not persuaded by the Prosecution’s sentencing approach. In my view, having given due consideration to the relevant sentencing considerations and the facts of this case, the individual and global sentences that I decided to impose adequately reflect the overall offending of the four accused and achieved the deterrent effect, while ensuring proportionality and parity.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In summary, the following sentences were imposed:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="15.52%"/> <col width="37.38%"/> <col width="23.06%"/> <col width="24.04%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>CHY</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Pre-amendment charges</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 week’s imprisonment </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="2" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total: 3 weeks’ imprisonment; with 2 charges ordered to run consecutively. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Post-amendment charges</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 weeks’ imprisonment </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>SCN</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Pre-amendment charges</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$15,000 per charge</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="2" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total: $120,000</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Post-amendment charges</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$20,000 for 3 charges &amp; $30,000 for one charge</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sindok</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Pre-amendment charge</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$10,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total: $10,000</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Laurich</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Post-amendment charge</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$10,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total: $10,000</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     At the time of preparing these grounds, CHY was on bail pending the hearing of his appeal and SCN, Sindok and Laurich had not paid the fines imposed.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>In the later part of 2016, the payments were forwarded to CHY’s personal bank accounts.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>At paragraph 8(a)(ii) in Resolution 1718.
