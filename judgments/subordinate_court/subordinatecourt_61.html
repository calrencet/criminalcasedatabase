corridor on the 20th floor of Block 448A Bukit Batok West Avenue 9, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Islam Mohammad Ariful, by means of a cement scraper, an instrument which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death, <em>to wit</em>, by hitting him once on the mouth with the cement scraper, causing him to suffer a deep laceration on the right upper lip, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 324 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Punishment prescribed by law</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The

However, DW4 confirmed that it was recorded in Exhibit D4 that the Accused had complained of giddiness and this could have impaired his orientation, but it was a transient thing. DW4 also noted that it was recorded in Exhibit D4 that the Accused had complained of “pain over C7 spine, thoracic spine, non-vertiginous giddiness improving”.

On the morning of 14 October 2017, at about 10.30 a.m., while the Accused and the victim, PW6, were working on the 20th floor of Block 448A Bukit Batok West Avenue 9 (then under construction), they got into an argument over a broom and tussled over it at the common corridor, during which the Accused hit PW6 once on the mouth with a cement scraper, causing a deep laceration on PW6’s right upper lip. The Accused was subsequently charged for the present offence under section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), for voluntarily causing hurt to PW6 with the cement scraper which, when used as a weapon of offence, was likely to cause death.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     During the recording of the Accused’s cautioned statement (Exhibit P9) on the morning of 15 October 2017, the Accused did not deny the charge or mention anything in his defence.

His upper lip laceration was sutured, and he was given two days’ medical leave3 and analgesia. While Exhibit P2 stated that the assailant had “used a cement scraper as a weapon, and <em>inadvertently</em> sliced patient’s upper lip”, PW2 (who did not examine the victim) had clarified that the word “inadvertently” was mistakenly written into Exhibit P2, and that no such word was found in the clinical notes, which he had relied on to prepare Exhibit P2<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_364" id="Ftn_364_1"><sup>[note: 364]</sup></a></span>.

While the scraper used by the Accused could not be found, the first responding police officer PW4 had photographed a similar looking scraper, as shown in exhibits P5(f) and P5(g), which he described as having sharp edges<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_366" id="Ftn_366_1"><sup>[note: 366]</sup></a></span>.

The Prosecution also noted that the Defence did not challenge PW6’s evidence in this regard.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The Prosecution had submitted that since the cement scraper was a sharp instrument capable of causing serious injuries, it was likely to cause death when used as a weapon of offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accused had intended hurt to result from his action</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The Prosecution submitted that the mental element required for the offence was that the Accused had intended hurt to result from his action or knew that it was likely that hurt would so result. Intention and knowledge could be inferred from the Accused’s objective conduct and all the surrounding circumstances (<em>Muhammad Khalis</em> at [42]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The Prosecution submitted that in the present case, the surrounding evidence gave rise to the irresistible inference that the Accused had intended to cause or knew that his action was likely to cause hurt to PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused knew that his right hand was holding a scraper.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    At the time of the incident, the Accused clearly knew that he was holding a cement scraper in his right hand. This was evident from his Case for the Defence (Exhibit P11) at [4], which stated that he was holding the scraper in his right hand after he found the disputed broom<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_369" id="Ftn_369_1"><sup>[note: 369]</sup></a></span>. During the trial, the Accused could also recall that he was holding the scraper in his right hand immediately before the acts of violence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_370" id="Ftn_370_1"><sup>[note: 370]</sup></a></span>. Further, Exhibit P11 did not state that he had forgotten or did not know that he was holding a scraper in his right hand. When cross-examined on Exhibit P11, the Accused had no explanation for the omission of what is supposedly very important to his defence and could only say that forgetting that the scraper was in his right hand was <em>not important</em> to his defence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_371" id="Ftn_371_1"><sup>[note: 371]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The Prosecution was of the view that logically speaking, it was incredible that the Accused could <em>momentarily</em> forget that he was holding the scraper, which was not a small object. This was evident from the photographs of a similar scraper in Exhibits P5(f) and P5(g), which suggested that the scraper was of a significant length, with a solid metal blade that was capable of scraping floor tiles<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_372" id="Ftn_372_1"><sup>[note: 372]</sup></a></span>. Therefore, the scraper could not have been of insignificant weight, and the Accused must have felt its weight when he was holding it in his right hand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Significantly, after the incident, when interviewed by the police officers at the scene, the Accused claimed that he could not recall the details of his scuffle with PW6<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_373" id="Ftn_373_1"><sup>[note: 373]</sup></a></span>,13 and had refused to answer the police officers when asked if any weapon was used during the scuffle<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_374" id="Ftn_374_1"><sup>[note: 374]</sup></a></span>. In this regard, the Accused acknowledged that if he had admitted to hitting someone with a scraper, it would lead to serious consequences for him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_375" id="Ftn_375_1"><sup>[note: 375]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    When asked by the Court to explain why he did not tell the police the truth, the Accused could not provide a logical explanation. He initially claimed that the police officer did not ask him how the incident took place<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_376" id="Ftn_376_1"><sup>[note: 376]</sup></a></span>, before alleging that he was asked the questions in a “very fast manner”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_377" id="Ftn_377_1"><sup>[note: 377]</sup></a></span>. This was incredible given his own testimony that the police officer had questioned him at least twice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_378" id="Ftn_378_1"><sup>[note: 378]</sup></a></span>.The responding police officer, PW8, also testified that he had asked the Accused several times about the details of the scuffle, but the Accused had claimed that he could not recall what had happened<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_379" id="Ftn_379_1"><sup>[note: 379]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Considering the aforesaid, the Prosecution submitted that the irresistible inference was that at all material times, the Accused knew he was holding a scraper in his right hand, and was trying to hide the truth that he had hit PW6 on the mouth with the scraper.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused deliberately thrust the scraper towards PW6’s mouth </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The Prosecution submitted that the manner which the scraper was thrust towards PW6’s mouth suggested that it was a deliberate act of aggression, rather than accidental or defensive in nature. PW6 had testified that while they were tugging back and forth on the broom, the Accused’s right hand, which was holding a scraper, suddenly pushed upwards towards his lips<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_380" id="Ftn_380_1"><sup>[note: 380]</sup></a></span>. The Prosecution also pointed out that the Defence did not dispute the manner the scraper was thrusted towards PW6’s mouth, in a <b>fast</b><em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_381" id="Ftn_381_1"><sup>[note: 381]</sup></a></span></em> upward motion, as described by PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The Accused also gave a similar description of what happened in his long statement (Exhibit P10) at [3], where he said that they were both tugging at the broom, during which PW6 pushed him, and he retaliated by swinging his right hand, which was holding a scraper, towards PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The Prosecution submitted that from the manner and target area of the attack (i.e. the face) which was a vulnerable part of the body, the only inference to be drawn was that the Accused had intended to cause hurt to PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accused’s defence was unbelievable</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The Prosecution noted that the crux of the Defence’s case was that the Accused was acting in self-defence. In particular, the Accused had alleged that PW6 had strangled him first and he tried to push PW6 away with his right hand, without realising that he was holding a scraper, causing the scraper to hit PW6’s face, and he was subsequently beaten up by four men (including PW6).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused’s testimony was inconsistent with his long statement </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Despite conceding that the investigation officer, PW7, had recorded in the long statement (Exhibit P10) whatever he had told him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_382" id="Ftn_382_1"><sup>[note: 382]</sup></a></span>, the Accused disputed the accuracy of the long statement, where he gave a different account about what had happened, as set out in the table below.

He also read and explained the statement to the Accused in Mandarin, and the Accused understood the statement before signing it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_402" id="Ftn_402_1"><sup>[note: 402]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In any event, the Prosecution noted that the Accused had conceded during cross-examination that PW7 recorded (in English) whatever that the Accused had told him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_403" id="Ftn_403_1"><sup>[note: 403]</sup></a></span>. It was noteworthy that the Accused clearly understood more English than he would have liked the Court to believe. During the trial, there were several times when he answered the Court’s questions before they were translated to him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_404" id="Ftn_404_1"><sup>[note: 404]</sup></a></span>. He was also observed to be reading the long statement on his own during his evidence-in-chief<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_405" id="Ftn_405_1"><sup>[note: 405]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Considering the aforesaid, the Prosecution submitted that there was no reason to doubt that PW7 had faithfully and accurately recorded the Accused’s long statement (Exhibit P10). The Prosecution submitted that the material discrepancies between the Accused’s testimony and Exhibit P10, called into serious question his credibility. The only reason for the discrepancies was that he had been hiding the truth, which was that he had intended to cause hurt to PW6 with the cement scraper.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stark inconsistencies pervaded the accused’s testimony</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The Prosecution submitted that as shown in the table above, there were stark inconsistencies in the Accused’s testimony. Depending on what portions of the evidence that one relied on, the Accused had taken multiple positions on what had transpired – including but not limited to stating that he only tussled with PW6 over the first disputed broom, and later claiming that he did not tussle over the broom at all.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The Accused also gave multiple versions of how he was allegedly assaulted by PW6 and three other workers. Significantly, in his account to DW5 at the hospital (as documented at page 2 of Exhibit D4), the Accused did not say that he was strangled or was suffering asphyxiation (he was only grabbed by the neck and pushed down). He also denied head injury and <em>only</em> said that he was kicked on the back, after three colleagues turned him over.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The Accused’s testimony in court varied in considerable details from what he had told PW5. He testified that immediately before he pushed or hit PW6 with a cement scraper, he was strangled by PW6 and PW6 pushed against a wall, and he had difficulty breathing. As for the events thereafter, the Accused claimed variously that he was kicked and punched on the back and lower back, hit on the shoulder, kicked on the left side of the body, and fell face down or face up, during which his head hit the ground. The Prosecution submitted that this was incredible, considering that clinical examination revealed that he only suffered mild pain over the upper back (near the neck region)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_406" id="Ftn_406_1"><sup>[note: 406]</sup></a></span> and the lower neck<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_407" id="Ftn_407_1"><sup>[note: 407]</sup></a></span>, and mild excoriations on the anterior neck<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_408" id="Ftn_408_1"><sup>[note: 408]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The Prosecution also noted that there were also material inconsistencies between the Accused’s testimony and what he had supposedly told his boss, DW2 and his supervisor, DW3 about the incident:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused told DW2 that after PW6 had strangled him, he was pinned down by three other men who did not attack him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_409" id="Ftn_409_1"><sup>[note: 409]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused gave a different account to DW3, saying that while he was fighting with PW6, a few other workers appeared, and they all fought with him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_410" id="Ftn_410_1"><sup>[note: 410]</sup></a></span>. The Prosecution submitted that it was noteworthy that DW3’s testimony in court differed from his statement to the police (Exhibit P12), wherein he said (at [3]) that the Accused only told him that he had a scuffle with “a dark complexion worker” over a broom, and sustained neck injury. In fact, DW3 stated at one point during cross-examination, that the Accused only told him that he had a fight with PW6 over the broom<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_411" id="Ftn_411_1"><sup>[note: 411]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The Prosecution was of the view that the fact that one could not, with any confidence, understood what precisely the Defence’s case was, spoke of one obvious point – the Accused was making up his testimony as he went along, resulting in a whole host of inconsistencies in his narrative of what had transpired.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accused could not rely on Private Defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The Prosecution also took the position that the Accused’s claim that he was acting in self-defence was unmeritorious.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Chor Jin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0306.xml')">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 306</a> at [46] held that a person purporting to exercise the right of private defence of the body pursuant to sections 96 to 106 of the Penal Code would need to show the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_a"></a>(a)     An offence affecting the human body had been committed or was reasonably apprehended;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_b"></a>(b)     From an objective point of view, there was no time to seek the protection of the public authorities;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_c"></a>(c)     From a subjective point of view, the person reasonably apprehended danger due to an attempt or a threat by the victim to commit an offence affecting the body; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_d"></a>(d)     The harm caused to the victim was reasonably necessary in private defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The Court of Appeal also highlighted at [46(c)] that if the defender was the aggressor at the material time, it was <em>prima facie</em> less likely that he had a right of private defence. Specifically, if the defender was armed with a deadly weapon from the outset, it was very unlikely that the right of private defence would ever arise.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The Prosecution had submitted that based on the totality of the evidence adduced at trial, <em>none</em> of the elements of private defence were satisfied.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused was the initial aggressor</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In the present case, both the Accused and PW6 had given conflicting accounts. The Accused claimed that PW6 had grabbed his neck first (“<b>the Accused’s version</b>”), while PW6 had alleged that the Accused had hit him first on the mouth with a scraper (“<b>PW6’s version</b>”). On a careful reading of the evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the court should accept PW6’s version, which was both internally consistent and corroborated by multiple strands of external evidence, in stark contrast to the various inconsistencies that plagued the Accused’s evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    PW6 had testified that the Accused had suddenly hit him on the upper lip with a scraper when they were tugging at the broom. After he realised that he was bleeding on the lip, PW6 held the Accused by the throat (or grabbed his neck)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_412" id="Ftn_412_1"><sup>[note: 412]</sup></a></span> and pushed him. Soon thereafter, other workers came and separated them<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_413" id="Ftn_413_1"><sup>[note: 413]</sup></a></span>. PW6 denied that three co-workers came to his assistance and assaulted the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_414" id="Ftn_414_1"><sup>[note: 414]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The Prosecution submitted that PW6’s version was internally consistent. In particular, he maintained the following material points, not deviating from the thrust of such evidence even during cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_415" id="Ftn_415_1"><sup>[note: 415]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_a"></a>(a)     There was only one disputed broom;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_b"></a>(b)     PW6 had tussled with the Accused over the broom;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_c"></a>(c)     While tussling over the broom, the Accused had hit PW6 on the mouth with a scraper; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_139-p2_d"></a>(d)     Thereafter, PW6 had grabbed the Accused’s throat and pushed the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The Prosecution submitted that PW6’s version was also externally consistent as it was corroborated by the Accused’s long statement, the evidence provided by the first responding police officer PW4, and the witness, PW5. The corroborated evidence could be summarised as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_a"></a>(a)     In his long statement Exhibit P10 (at [3]), the Accused said that he had swung his right hand, which was holding a scraper, at PW6 while they were tugging at the broom.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_b"></a>(b)     PW4, who had interviewed PW6 at the scene, testified that PW6 had informed him that he got into a scuffle with the Accused over a broom, during which the Accused had hit his upper lip with a metal object<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_416" id="Ftn_416_1"><sup>[note: 416]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_c"></a>(c)     While PW5 did not witness the actual tussle between the Accused and PW6, his testimony supported PW6’s version. Specifically, only the Accused and PW6 were involved in the tussle, and the Accused was not beaten up by PW6 and three other workers as the Accused had alleged. According to PW5, he was working nearby when he heard people quarrelling. He then went to the scene of the quarrel and saw the Accused fighting with PW6 on the ground. PW5 and other unidentified workers subsequently separated the two of them<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_417" id="Ftn_417_1"><sup>[note: 417]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Considering the aforesaid, the Prosecution submitted that the court should accept PW6’s version as true i.e., the Accused was the initial aggressor at the material time, who had first hit PW6 on the mouth with a cement scraper.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The Prosecution therefore submitted that no offence affecting the human body was committed on the Accused immediately before the Accused hit the victim with a cement scraper. PW6 was merely tugging at the broom and did not attempt or threaten physical harm to the Accused. The Accused had no cause to reasonably apprehend any danger to his person and did not have a right of private defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused had inflicted more harm than necessary for the purpose of any alleged self-defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Even if PW6 had pushed the Accused, the Prosecution was of the view that the Accused had inflicted more harm than was reasonably necessary in private defence, by hitting PW6 on a vulnerable part of the body with a dangerous weapon, causing a deep laceration on the right upper lip.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    It was only fortuitous that PW6 did not suffer grievous hurt.

However, the Defence was of the view that the Accused was not cognisant of the scraper in his hand when he was trying to get himself out of PW6’s grip on his neck.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Defence had submitted that tacit knowledge of what had caused injury to PW6 after the incident had taken place was distinct from the Accused's actual knowledge in the heat of the moment that he was holding on to a scraper in his right hand. The former was a realisation of what had transpired while the latter pointed towards the active state of mind of the Accused during a scuffle that had triggered a fight or flight response.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">ii.   The Accused did not deliberately thrust the scraper towards the victim's mouth</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    While the Defence did not dispute the fact that the Accused had thrust the scraper towards PW6’s mouth, the Defence was of the view that the Accused was not cognisant of the scraper in his hand at the material time of the offence. This was evident from the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_a"></a>(a)     When seen in context of the Accused being grabbed around the neck by PW6 at the time of the incident, the Defence submitted that it was not difficult to come to a logical conclusion that the Accused was using his free hand to push PW6 away.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_b"></a>(b)     As both the Accused and PW6 were tugging on the broom which was on the Accused's left hand,<sup></sup>it meant that the Accused's only hand which was unencumbered by PW6 was his right hand.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Defence submitted that there was nothing else that the Accused could have done at that point in time to get PW6 to release his hands around the Accused's neck.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_d"></a>(d)     The lack of follow-up by the Accused after a single push with his right hand which resulted in PW6 releasing his grip on the Accused's neck also pointed towards the lack of intention on the part of the Accused to cause hurt to PW6. It was just an unfortunate circumstance on the part of the Accused that he was unaware of the cement scraper in his right hand.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">iii.   No evidence of previous enmity</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Prior to this incident, the Accused and PW6 had no previous interactions other than being workers in a common area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    There were no demonstrations of hatred or a desire to hurt PW6 and the Accused had no reason to hurt PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">iv.   Overt act and declarations</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    PW6 was the one who had angrily approached the Accused or confronted the Accused.

The Accused had resisted and wanted to get out of the hold on his neck. The cement scraper which the Accused was holding in his right hand appeared to have hit PW6 across the lips once.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Further, there were no declarations or threats made by the Accused towards PW6. In fact, the only declaration made was by PW6 to the Accused, who shouted “what do you want to do?” (in Mandarin) before walking aggressively towards the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_425" id="Ftn_425_1"><sup>[note: 425]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">v.   Amount of violence used and nature of weapon selected</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The Defence had pointed out that the whole altercation between the Accused and PW6 had taken place within a few minutes. Further, at no point in time was the Accused angered during the altercation as the Accused himself had confirmed that he was not angry<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_426" id="Ftn_426_1"><sup>[note: 426]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    The Accused’s first move was to push PW6 away from him. There was no intention exhibited during the pushing, that the Accused had wanted to hurt PW6<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_427" id="Ftn_427_1"><sup>[note: 427]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    The Accused only realised that the cement scraper was still in his hand after he had pushed out towards PW6<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_428" id="Ftn_428_1"><sup>[note: 428]</sup></a></span>. The push was also in the general direction of PW6.

The push with the cement scraper was just once, with no other intention other than to stop PW6 from grabbing his neck. This was corroborated by PW6’s statement that the Accused had only hit his face once<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_430" id="Ftn_430_1"><sup>[note: 430]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">vi.   Whether the Accused knew of the danger of the cement scraper</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    The Defence submitted that in considering the nature of the weapon used and Section 324 of the Penal Code, it was important to consider whether the Accused <em>knew</em> that he was holding a dangerous weapon.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    The Accused would use a cement scraper in the course of his work<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_431" id="Ftn_431_1"><sup>[note: 431]</sup></a></span>. This was corroborated by PW6. At the material time when the Accused hit PW6, he would not have thought about whether he was holding on to the cement scraper as he was attacked first. With it being a fight or flight response, the Accused could not have anticipated the injury on PW6 as his only thought was to push PW6 away. This must be seen in the context of the Accused being grabbed around his neck, with the severity of the injuries to be elaborated below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The Accused had been consistent in his statements that he did not realise that he was holding a cement scraper in his hand when giving a push to PW6 as mentioned earlier<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_432" id="Ftn_432_1"><sup>[note: 432]</sup></a></span>. This was consistent with PW6’s statement that the Accused was already holding on to the cement scraper before the dispute<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_433" id="Ftn_433_1"><sup>[note: 433]</sup></a></span>. PW5 reiterated this point when he noticed that both of the Accused’s hands were holding on to something when they first met<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_434" id="Ftn_434_1"><sup>[note: 434]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The Defence submitted that the Accused did not have the intention to cause hurt to PW6.

Any reasonable person would have not wanted to get the police involved if he or she knew that there would be criminal liability.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">viii.   PW6 had motive to frame the Accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    The Defence submitted that it would have made no sense for PW6 to hold the Accused’s throat and push his neck after his own lips were injured. It was beyond belief that PW6 would go nearer towards the Accused who was holding on to both a broom and a cement scraper after he realised that he was bleeding from his lip<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_436" id="Ftn_436_1"><sup>[note: 436]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    The Defence was of the view that PW6 had a clear motive to lie about the true nature of the incident between him and the Accused as he knew that he might have been criminally liable for being the aggressor who had initiated the scuffle.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Right of Private Defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    The Defence agreed with the Prosecution that the law relating to private defence was laid down in the case of <em>Tan Chor Jin v PP</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    In applying the principles as laid down in <em>Tan Chor Jin v PP</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_174-p2_a"></a>(a)     On the issue of “reasonable apprehension of danger”, the Defence was of the view that the Accused had “reasonable apprehension of danger” as he was grabbed by the neck by PW6. This would constitute an offence against the Accused’s body. The abrasions on the Accused’s neck, as evidenced by Exhibits D1 and D2 and DW5’s clinical notes (Exhibit D4) and DW4’s medical report (Exhibit D3) showed that the Accused had suffered excoriations at his neck area. The Accused had reasonably apprehended ie perceived that an offence was being made against his body at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_174-p2_b"></a>(b)     As for the “duration of private defence”, the Defence highlighted that even by PW6’s own account, the Accused had only swung his arm <em>once</em> at PW6’s face<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_437" id="Ftn_437_1"><sup>[note: 437]</sup></a></span>. There was no flurry of blows. It was therefore clear that the duration which the Accused exercised the right of private defence was commensurate to the danger which he had apprehended.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_174-p2_c"></a>(c)     On the issue of “use of necessary force”, the Defence pointed out that it was the Accused’s position that he did not remember that he was holding on to the cement scraper at the material time. It was also the Accused’s position that he was grabbed by the neck and pushed against the wall. Although PW6 was unarmed at the time, the neck was a vulnerable area and prolonged force exerted on the neck could have led to a serious injury or even death. It would be reasonable to assume that a person who had grabbed the Accused by the neck was intending to cause serious injury to the Accused. Also, actual injury suffered by PW6 was not that serious as PW1 had only called the police and not an ambulance, and it was the police who had called for the ambulance. The Defence also noted that PW6 was only given a short medical certificate period of 2 days, as opposed to the Accused, who was given 14 days medical leave. In addition, according to PW3, who examined PW6, PW6 had some pain but it did not seem very much at the point of the consultation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_438" id="Ftn_438_1"><sup>[note: 438]</sup></a></span>. PW6 was discharged with analgesia and did not have to be hospitalised.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    The Defence was also of the view that the Accused did not inflict more harm than necessary:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_175-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused was grabbed by the neck, which was a vulnerable part of the body. Excoriations were caused on his neck, and it was notable that this was likely caused by the scratching of fingernails.<sup></sup>The Defence highlighted that this was pertinent as it indicated the level of force used on the Accused when he was grabbed by the neck. The Defence also noted that the Accused repeatedly used the word "strangle" in his evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_439" id="Ftn_439_1"><sup>[note: 439]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>and said that he could not breathe when he had been grabbed by the neck.<sup></sup>As such, the Accused would necessarily have been afraid for his person.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_175-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Defence also noted that PW6 only gave evidence of one hit by the Accused. According to PW6, they were immediately separated after PW6 gave the Accused a push.<sup></sup>This was not a case where the Accused inflicted multiple injuries in retaliation. This was instead one instinctual movement to get PW6 to stop grabbing the Accused by the neck.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Given the above, the Defence submitted that the force exerted by the Accused, which involved pushing his arm towards PW6’s face whilst holding on to the cement scraper, should be considered reasonably necessary force. This would be the case even if the Accused were cognizant that he was holding onto the cement scraper.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The Defence emphasized that the Accused was reacting in a fight or flight scenario, and that the force used should not be weighed in golden scales. At the material time, the Accused could not have been calmly measuring the force he should have used. He reacted instinctively to protect himself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The Defence therefore submitted that all the conditions of the right of private defence had been satisfied.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasonable doubts in relation to Prosecution’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    The Defence submitted that the following would constitute reasonable doubts in the Prosecution’s case:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_179-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Defence submitted that PW6’s evidence to the police was not internally consistent:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       During his Evidence in Chief, PW6 admitted that <em>all</em> his fingers had made contact with the Accused’s throat and that he had given the Accused a push without applying any pressure<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_440" id="Ftn_440_1"><sup>[note: 440]</sup></a></span>. PW6 later said that he had held the Accused’s throat and had pushed his neck and that he had told this to the police<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_441" id="Ftn_441_1"><sup>[note: 441]</sup></a></span>. Subsequently, PW6 denied that the neck injury was caused by him and said that he could not remember exactly where he grabbed the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_442" id="Ftn_442_1"><sup>[note: 442]</sup></a></span>. PW6 then changed his mind and admitted that he had grabbed the Accused on the neck<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_443" id="Ftn_443_1"><sup>[note: 443]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The Defence also highlighted that PW6’s evidence was not internally consistent. While PW6 had admitted that he had grabbed the Accused on the neck, he had refused to admit to the possibility that the neck injury was caused by his actions. PW6 also denied that the neck injury was caused by him, claiming without evidence that other people who had pulled the Accused and PW6 apart could have caused the neck injury<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_444" id="Ftn_444_1"><sup>[note: 444]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The Defence also submitted that PW6’s explanation of the Accused’s injuries was nothing more than an afterthought. It was incredulous that someone separating PW6 and the Accused could have caused such excoriations on the Accused’s neck but have left PW6 un-scuffed. In addition, PW6’s account appeared unbelievable. First, PW6 admitted that all his fingers made contact with the Accused’s throat. But then PW6 said that he gave a “push” without applying any pressure. The fact that all his fingers had made contact with the Accused’s throat suggested there was a clear intention to grab the Accused by the neck. It was also unclear how one could give a “push” without applying any pressure to the neck. In addition, it appeared strange that excoriations on the Accused’s neck, which were abrasions caused by fingernails, could have been caused if it had been one quick “push” without any pressure to the neck.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Defence also noted that PW6’s account of what he had said to the police was inconsistent with what the police themselves recalled. PW4 noted that PW6 appeared “reluctant to answer” when questioned about how the fight had occurred<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_445" id="Ftn_445_1"><sup>[note: 445]</sup></a></span>. In contrast, PW6 said that he had informed the police that he had grabbed the Accused by the neck<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_446" id="Ftn_446_1"><sup>[note: 446]</sup></a></span>. The Defence submitted that this was clearly an afterthought by PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       The Defence submitted that PW6 had a clear motive to lie about the true nature of the incident between him and the Accused, and to give evidence favourable to him.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_a-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       In light of the aforesaid, the Defence urged me to reduce the weight placed on PW6’s evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_179-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Defence also pointed out that PW6’s evidence of how the fight occurred contradicted that of PW5<b>:</b></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       PW5 had testified that when he witnessed the incident, the Accused and PW6 were on the ground<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_447" id="Ftn_447_1"><sup>[note: 447]</sup></a></span>. PW5 was quite clear that the Accused and PW6 were on the ground for about 2 minutes before they were separated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_448" id="Ftn_448_1"><sup>[note: 448]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       In contrast, PW6 had insisted that he and the Accused <b>never</b> ended up on the ground. His account stated that they were standing throughout the whole incident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_449" id="Ftn_449_1"><sup>[note: 449]</sup></a></span>. PW6 also stated that immediately after he had pushed the Accused’s throat, other workers came to separate them<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_450" id="Ftn_450_1"><sup>[note: 450]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The Defence highlighted that PW5, as a neutral eyewitness who was not involved in the fight, would have no reason to lie about what he had witnessed. In contrast, PW6 would be motivated to lie about what had occurred in order to reduce the likelihood of criminal liability.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Defence submitted that PW6 was lying about what had occurred. If the Accused and PW6 had stopped fighting immediately after he had pushed the Accused’s throat, there would have been no need for other workers to have stepped in to separate them. In contrast, if they had been struggling on the floor for a couple of minutes, there would be a need for the other workers to step in to separate them.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_b-p3_v"></a>(v)       The Defence submitted that PW5’s account appeared to be more credible. PW6 might have wanted to hide the truth behind how the Accused and himself had ended up on the ground. For instance, if he had held the Accused down or pushed him down, or if three other friends of PW6 had been present to beat up and pin the Accused down on to the ground, PW6 would have wished to steer clear of the fact that the Accused and himself had ended up on the ground.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_b-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       The Defence thus submitted that less weight should be given to PW6’s evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_179-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Defence was also of the view that there were numerous procedural issues with the way the Accused’s offence was investigated. In addition, there were inconsistencies in the evidence given by the police officers:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       As regard to the decision to place the Accused under arrest:</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_i-p4_A"></a>(A)       PW7 was informed that there was a fight between the Accused and PW6<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_451" id="Ftn_451_1"><sup>[note: 451]</sup></a></span>. PW7 also gave evidence in court that he understood that the word “fight” to mean that there was an exchange of blows and that it was not a one-sided attack<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_452" id="Ftn_452_1"><sup>[note: 452]</sup></a></span>. Nevertheless, even though he was informed that there was a fight, he made the decision to place only the Accused under arrest, and not PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_i-p4_B"></a>(B)       The decision appeared to have been made primarily based on PW6’s account that the Accused had attacked PW6 with a scraper and that when the Accused was questioned, he denied hitting PW6<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_453" id="Ftn_453_1"><sup>[note: 453]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_i-p4_C"></a>(C)       The Defence also noted that PW7 had first stated that he was aware that the Accused had complained of pain and he was conveyed to the hospital before PW7 decided to arrest the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_454" id="Ftn_454_1"><sup>[note: 454]</sup></a></span>.

The Accused had also said that he did not see and was not sure how he obtained the knocks on the head area<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_459" id="Ftn_459_1"><sup>[note: 459]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_ii-p4_C"></a>(C)       The Defence noted that it was PW8’s own evidence during re-examination that the case stuck with him because he rarely came across cases involving voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_460" id="Ftn_460_1"><sup>[note: 460]</sup></a></span>. Yet, he could not recall a salient detail involving the injuries suffered by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_ii-p4_D"></a>(D)       The Defence submitted that PW8 appeared to recall more clearly the facts which he believed supported his view that the Accused was guilty of an offence.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       On the issue of PW7’s lack of knowledge of the Accused’s injuries:</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_A"></a>(A)       The Defence noted that PW4 had given evidence that the Accused’s injuries were photographed by one of the police officers at the scene, and that all the police officers were aware of the Accused’s injuries. PW4 also noted that the injuries on the Accused’s neck were the same as those on the photographs, Exhibits D1 and D2<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_461" id="Ftn_461_1"><sup>[note: 461]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_B"></a>(B)       PW8 also observed that there were scratches on the Accused’s neck area.

PW7 had also interviewed the Accused one day after the incident had occurred but photographs of the Accused’s injuries were not provided to him at the time of the interview<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_463" id="Ftn_463_1"><sup>[note: 463]</sup></a></span>.

However, PW7 was aware that the Accused had gone to the hospital earlier on<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_465" id="Ftn_465_1"><sup>[note: 465]</sup></a></span>.

When asked to justify why he though the Accused was the one at fault, PW7’s reply was that he had accepted PW6’s version of the event and he was not aware of the injuries on the Accused as he as not informed of the injuries from the officers at the scene<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_467" id="Ftn_467_1"><sup>[note: 467]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_D"></a>(D)       The Defence submitted that PW7 ought to have done his due diligence in investigating the circumstances of the offence more thoroughly before making the decision to charge the Accused. Once PW7 was aware that the Accused had gone to the hospital, he should have asked the Accused where he was injured and how the said injuries occurred as well as requested the medical report from Ng Teck Fong Hospital. The fact that he did not do so and instead relied on his own evaluation of the Accused’s injuries, suggested that the investigation was not thoroughly conducted.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_E"></a>(E)       In any event, the Defence submitted that it was implausible that PW7 had no knowledge that the Accused had been grabbed by the neck. The abrasions on the Accused’s neck were clearly visible and should have been easy to see, just one day later.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Defence also pointed out that PW7 had failed to record his initial interview with the Accused:</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iv-p4_A"></a>(A)       PW7 had given evidence that he first saw and interviewed the Accused at about 6 am on 15 October 2017<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_468" id="Ftn_468_1"><sup>[note: 468]</sup></a></span>. The Defence submitted that the interview had lasted about <b>45 minutes</b> as the cautioned statement was recorded at 6.45am, after the interview<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_469" id="Ftn_469_1"><sup>[note: 469]</sup></a></span>. The oral account was not recorded in any way by PW7.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iv-p4_B"></a>(B)       The Defence submitted that the usual procedure before a statement was recorded was not followed in this case and there was no documentary evidence of what was said to PW7 during the oral interview, nor of the questions asked by PW7.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_iv-p4_C"></a>(C)       It was only after the initial oral interview that PW7 decided to record a cautioned statement from the Accused. The Defence submitted that PW7’s account of the oral interview must be viewed with circumspection as there was no other record of what had actually occurred.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_v"></a>(v)       The Accused’s cautioned statement was recorded prior to his long statement:</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_v-p4_A"></a>(A)       The Accused’s cautioned statement was recorded at 6.45am in the morning on 15 October 2017.

However, in the present case, PW7 had proceeded to record the Accused’s cautioned statement before he had recorded the Accused’s his long statement.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_179-p2_c-p3_v-p4_C"></a>(C)       The Defence submitted that PW7 already had a pre-conceived notion that the Accused was guilty of an offence prior to recording of his long statement. This was buttressed by the fact that the cautioned statement was recorded 12 hours before the Accused’s long statement was recorded.

The Accused was sent to the hospital after the incident. The first person that the Accused spoke to at the hospital was the triage nurse. The triage nurse had recorded the Accused’s complaints at 12.32 pm as: “<em>assaulted by colleague, strangled over neck region. Nil voice changes/ SOB. Redness over neck noted. Nil HI.

The Defence was of the view that a layperson’s understanding of the word “strangled” could be different from that of a doctor. DW4 had clarified that it was necessary to distinguish between the word “grabbed” or “strangled” because they “mean different things in terms of intention” to a doctor.

As such, the Accused could have used both words inter-changeably.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_179-p2_e-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Defence also pointed out that the triage nurse was not a trained physician<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_492" id="Ftn_492_1"><sup>[note: 492]</sup></a></span>.

DW5 had corroborated the evidence given by the Accused in several material aspects. Firstly, DW5 had noted that the Accused was grabbed by the neck. DW5 had also found excoriations on the Accused’s anterior neck<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_494" id="Ftn_494_1"><sup>[note: 494]</sup></a></span>. This clearly supported the Accused’s evidence that he was grabbed by the neck by PW5. Secondly, DW5 noted that the Accused told him that he was pushed down and he landed on his buttocks<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_495" id="Ftn_495_1"><sup>[note: 495]</sup></a></span>. The Defence was of the view that this corroborated the Accused’s account of events. Thirdly, DW5 noted that the Accused had been turned over by three other colleagues and they then kicked his back<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_496" id="Ftn_496_1"><sup>[note: 496]</sup></a></span>. This corroborated the Accused’s account that three other people had also assaulted him, other than PW6. Fourth, the pain over C7 spine and thoracic spine indicated that there was indeed some injury to the Accused’s back. In addition, there was some pain over the C7 spine (neck region) when the Accused turned to the left<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_497" id="Ftn_497_1"><sup>[note: 497]</sup></a></span>.

The Defence reiterated that the Accused had consistently given evidence that he had not been cognizant of the fact that he was holding onto a cement scraper when he swung his hand at PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In addition, the Accused was reacting to an offence made against his body, namely, the grabbing of his neck by PW6. The Defence was of the view that the conditions of the right of private defence had been made out as the Accused did not have the time to contact the authorities.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Given the above, the Defence submitted that the court should acquit the Accused of the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My findings and decision</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law and elements of the charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    The relevant statutory provisions in relation to the current charge were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“<b>Hurt</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>319</b>.    Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>Explanation.</em> — A person is said to cause hurt if he causes another person to be unconscious.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Voluntarily causing hurt</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whoever does any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does thereby cause hurt to any person, is said “voluntarily to cause hurt”.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>324</b>.    Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt by means of any instrument for shooting, stabbing or cutting, or any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, or by means of fire or any heated substance, or by means of any poison or corrosive substance, or by means of any explosive substance, or by means of any substance which is harmful to the human body to inhale, to swallow, or to receive into the blood, or by means of any animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    In the present case, in order to secure a conviction against the Accused, the Prosecution would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_185-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused had used a cement scraper to hit PW6 once on the mouth;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_185-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused had done the act with the intention to cause hurt or with the knowledge that he is likely to cause hurt to PW6; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_185-p2_c"></a>(c)     The cement scraper was an instrument which, if used as a weapon of offence, was likely to cause death.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable law in reviewing the evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    In the present case, it was clear evidence that the Accused had hit PW6 once in the mouth with a cement scraper and that had caused a laceration on PW6’s upper lip involving the vermillion border.

This requirement was laid down in Federation of Malaya High Court decision of <em>Public Prosecutor v Mardai</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/32414-M.xml')">[1950] MLJ 33</a> where Spencer- Wilkinson J declared (at 33), as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">Whilst there is no rule of law in this country that in sexual offences the evidence of the complainant must be corroborated; nevertheless, it appears to me, as a matter of common sense, to be unsafe to convict in cases of this kind unless either the evidence of the complainant is unusually convincing or there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story. <b>It would be sufficient, in my view, if that corroboration consisted only of a subsequent complaint by complainant herself provided that the statement implicated the Appellant and was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The EA did not, at its inception, provide a definition of corroboration and still does not do so. In <em>Liton</em> ([111] <em>supra</em>), this court (at [43]) preferred Spencer-Wilkinson J’s more liberal approach to corroboration (“liberal corroboration”) as opposed to the stricter traditional common law definition laid down in <em>The King v Baskerville</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/51973-E-M.xml')">[1916] 2 KB 658</a> at 667 (“<em>Baskerville</em>”) of independent evidence implicating the Appellant in a material particular (“<em>Baskerville</em> corroboration”):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]t is clear that the Baskerville standard … does not apply in its strict form in Singapore since Yong CJ, in <em>Tang Kin Seng</em> ([37] supra), advocated a liberal approach in determining whether a piece of evidence can amount to corroboration. This is so, notwithstanding Yong CJ’s apparent allusion to the whole or part of the Baskerville standard in <em>B v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0400.xml')">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 400</a> (at [27]); <em>Lee Kwang Peng</em> ([38] supra) at [71]; and <em>Kwan Peng Hong</em> ([37] supra) at [37] as being ‘essential’ in nature. In our view, to adopt a stringent definition of what constitutes corroborative evidence goes against the liberal approach which Yong CJ himself alluded to as a broad principle of law in the other cases. In <em>Kwan Peng Hong</em> (at [36]), Yong CJ held that our courts ‘have left behind a technical and inflexible approach to corroboration and its definition’, and alluded to similar pronouncements in <em>Tang Kin Seng</em> (at [53]– [68]) and <em>Soh Yang Tick</em> ([37] supra at [43]). The principle of law which emerges from these cases is that <b>the local approach to locating corroborative evidence is liberal</b>, thus ensuring that the trial judge has the necessary flexibility to treat relevant evidence as corroborative. <b>What is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    It was also well established that minor inconsistencies in a witness’ testimony, could be disregarded if his testimony was substantially consistent and the minute details that varied did not discredit the witness. This was observed by CJ Yong Pung How (as he then was) in <b><em>Lim Thiam Hor and Anor v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 1 SLR(R) 0758.xml')">[1996] 1 SLR(R) 758</a>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“ [M]oreover, the <b>discrepancies could be explained by the simple reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in the same way.

The question was whether the alleged discrepancies were sufficient to destroy the credibility of PW1 and PW3. There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. A court is thus fully competent to accept one part of the witness’ testimony and to reject the other. <b>The testimony given by the prosecution witnesses were substantially consistent and the minute details that varied did not discredit them.</b> On the evidence, the findings by the trial judge were supportable on the facts and the discrepancies pointed out by the appellants were minor and not material.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">My assessment of the evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    In my evaluation of the evidence, I was prepared to accept the Prosecution’s position that the Accused had intended to hurt PW6 using the cement scraper or that he had the knowledge that what he had done was likely to cause hurt to PW6..

PW6 could not find his broom and he saw the Accused with the broom.

I was of the view that this was a minor inconsistency which could be disregarded as the rest of PW6’s his testimony was substantially consistent, and this fact did not discredit PW6 (see <b><em>Lim Thiam Hor and Anor v PP)</em></b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused’s evidence had material inconsistencies</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    The Accused’s defence was that PW6 was the aggressor who had attacked him first and he did not realise that he was holding onto the scraper when he tried to push PW6 away and he did not intend to cause hurt to PW6.

During his EIC in court, the Accused said that PW6 was the sole aggressor who had attacked the Accused and strangled his neck and had pushed him against the wall. The Accused had used his hand which was holding the scraper to push PW6 away because he was having difficulty breathing. I agreed with the Prosecution that, during his cross-examination, the Accused kept changing his position to whether he had tussled with PW6 over the broom. Initially, the Accused said that there was no tussle over the broom. However, he subsequently changed his story to say that he did tussle with PW6 over the broom before changing his position again to say that there was no tussle<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_574" id="Ftn_574_1"><sup>[note: 574]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_212-p2_d"></a>(d)     In Exhibit P10, the Accused had told PW7 that he had swung his right hand at PW6 because he wanted to throw a punch at PW6. However, in his EIC in court, the Accused said that he had merely pushed PW6 with his right hand as PW6 was strangling him and he was having difficulty breathing.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_212-p2_e"></a>(e)     In Exhibit P10, the Accused told PW7 that after he swung his hand at PW6, they had a scuffle and were pulled apart by other workers. However, in his EIC in court, the Accused said that he was assaulted by PW6 and 3 other workers who were with PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    I also noted that there were also material discrepancies between the evidence of the other witnesses (including the Defence witnesses), the exhibits tendered and the Accused’s evidence in court:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_213-p2_a"></a>(a)      <u>The Accused’s account of how he was attacked by PW6 and the other 3 workers:</u> </p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       In his EIC, the Accused had testified that PW6 had used his right hand to strangle the Accused and caused him to have difficulty breathing. The Accused used his right hand to push PW6 away and he accidently hit PW6 in the lip with his scraper. PW6 then used his left hand to grab the Accused’s right forearm and one of the 3 workers who was with PW6 had grabbed the Accused’s left hand which was holding onto the broom and had used both his hands to pull the Accused’s left hand causing him to turn around towards his right side and face the other side of the corridor. The other 2 workers then started kicking and punching him from behind in the back and lower back. PW6 and the worker who was holding onto the Accused’s left hand then dragged the Accused to the floor. The Accused was pushed backwards, and he fell to the ground. As the Accused was falling to the ground, he was hit on the shoulder. When the Accused fell, his body landed on the ground first followed by his head. After that, the Accused was beaten by the 4 men for about 3 to 5 minutes before the other workers cane to separate them. When the other workers came to separate them, the other 3 workers moved away while PW6 continued to pin him down.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       During cross-examination, the Accused said that he fell to the ground and landed on his buttocks first before his head hit the ground. One of the attackers then grabbed his arm with great force and turned him over. He was then pinned to the ground and beaten up by the other three assailants who hit him on the shoulder.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       However, DW5 who had examined the Accused, testified that the Accused told him that he had fought with his colleague over a broom and he was grabbed by the neck and pushed down and he landed on his buttocks. After that 3 other colleagues turned him over and the Accused felt someone kick his back. DW5 also testified that the Accused had never told him that he was hit on his shoulder and strangled by his colleague. The Accused also told DW5 that he did not suffer any neck or head injury when he landed on his buttocks. DW5 also said that the Accused did not inform him that his head had landed on the ground and that he had landed on his lower back. The Accused also did not inform DW5 that he was beaten on his back, he said he was kicked. The Accused also did not inform DW5 that he could not see properly. DW5 also said that the Accused did not tell him that he was pushed against a wall or that he was kicked and punched before he fell to the ground and that 4 persons had pinned him down.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Accused had also told PW4 that during his scuffle with PW6, he had felt some knocks on his head area, but he did not see how he was hit in the head.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       I also noted PW5’s testimony that he had proceed to the source of the quarrel and verbal arguments in less than 1 minute (as opposed to the 3 to 5 minutes that the Accused said he was attacked by the 4 workers) and he only saw the Accused and PW6 struggling with each other on the ground and other workers trying to separate them. PW5 did not mention that there were 3 other workers attacking the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       I noted that the Accused’s long statement in Exhibit P10 did not state that the Accused was strangled by PW6 and that he was attacked by 3 other persons other than PW6. PW7 who had recorded Exhibit P10 also testified that the Accused had never informed him that he was strangled by PW6 or that he was attacked by 3 other persons.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_vii"></a>(vii)       The Accused also did not mention that PW6 was the aggressor who had attacked the Accused first and that he was attacked by 3 other workers in his cautioned statement Exhibit P9.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_viii"></a>(viii)       I also noted that the Accused did not mention in his Case for the Defence (Exhibit P11) that PW6 had tried to strangle him but he merely stated that PW6 had grabbed his neck. Exhibit P11 also did not state that the Accused was attacked by 3 other workers. In this regard, I noted that during the trial, the Accused’s previous counsels had informed me that they had decided not to include this point into Exhibit P11 and they had subsequently proceeded to discharge themselves from further acting for the Accused as they could be called as Defence witnesses on this issue<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_575" id="Ftn_575_1"><sup>[note: 575]</sup></a></span>. I also noted that the Accused’s previous counsels were not called to testify on this issue after the Accused had appointed new counsels to act for him.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_ix"></a>(ix)       I agreed with the Prosecution that there were material inconsistencies between the Accused’s testimony and what he had told his boss DW2 and DW3 about the incident:</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_ix-p4_a"></a>(a)       The Accused had informed DW2 that after PW6 had strangled him, he was pinned down by three other men. He did not inform DW2 that he was attacked by the other three men.</p> <p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_213-p2_a-p3_ix-p4_b"></a>(b)       DW3 had in his EIC testified that the Accused had told him that while he was fighting with PW6, a few other workers appeared, and they all fought with him. I noted that the Prosecution had applied to impeach DW3’s testimony in court with his statement that he had given to the police earlier (Exhibit P12). In Exhibit P12, D3 had told PW7 that the Accused had informed him that he had a scuffle with a dark-complexioned worker. DW3 did not inform PW7 in Exhibit P12 that the Accused had told him that he was attacked by 3 other workers. Given all these, I was of the view that DW3’s evidence was unreliable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    The Accused’s injuries did not commensurate with the manner which the Accused had claimed he was attacked by PW6 and the other 3 workers:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_a"></a>(a)     DW4 and DW5 had testified that the injuries suffered by the Accused included mild tenderness over his cervical and upper thoracic spine. The Accused also suffered from mild excoriations in the anterior neck and mild pain with neck movements to the left<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_576" id="Ftn_576_1"><sup>[note: 576]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused had also complained to DW5 that he was having mild pain over the C7 spine and thoracic spine which referred to the lower part of the neck as well as the middle-upper part of the middle back.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_c"></a>(c)     DW5 had noted that there were “no neck swelling, no difficulty swallowing, no neck pain” which meant that DW4 did not observe any visible or palpable swelling in the Accused’s neck and the Accused did not complain of any difficulty when swallowing his saliva or water. DW5 also examined the Accused’s head and found no obvious visible injuries such as lacerations, haematomas or bruising.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_d"></a>(d)     DW5 had examined the Accused’s neck and he found that the Accused did not have any severe pain over his C7 spine as well as his middle back. When DW5 examined the Accused’s spine, the Accused informed DW5 that he felt pain when DW5 touched his C7 spine and the upper part of the thoracic spine which was about 1 to 3 cm below the C7 spine. DW5 explained that this was around the shoulder blade area.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_e"></a>(e)     DW5 also did not observe any physical injuries on the posterior part of the Accused’s neck and back. There was also no chest pain observed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_214-p2_f"></a>(f)     I was of the view that the injuries recorded of the Accused were clearly inconsistent with the manner in which the Accused was alleged to have been assaulted by PW6 and the other 3 workers. If the Accused had been punched and kicked on his back and lower back for 3 to 5 minutes by 4 persons, it was highly unlikely that there were no external injuries such as bruises or abrasions on the Accused’s body and back. If the Accused had been grabbed and pushed down and landed on his buttocks, it seemed strange that his injuries were only restricted to his neck and shoulder blade region. And if the Accused was dragged to the floor in a forceful manner and had been hit on the shoulder and had also hit his head on the ground, it seemed strange that there were no external injuries to his shoulder area as well as his head region.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    I also accepted all the inconsistencies in the Accused’s testimony as pointed out by the Prosecution in their Closing Submissions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    Given the above, I was of the view that the Accused’s testimony was both internally and externally inconsistent. As such, I would disregard the Accused’s evidence and accept PW6’s evidence on the chain of events which had taken place on the day of the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    As such, I was not prepared to accept the Accused’s evidence that PW6 was the aggressor who had tried to strangle the Accused first and that the Accused was merely defending himself. I would accept PW6’s evidence that both of them had fought over the broom and the Accused had used to scraper to hit at PW6 and caused the cut on PW6’s lip. And it was only after the Accused had cut PW6’s lip that PW6 went on to grab the Accused by the neck and thereby causing the excoriation on the Accused’s neck. Both parties then struggled with each other and they fell to the ground in a hugging manner<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_577" id="Ftn_577_1"><sup>[note: 577]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    For my reasons as stated above, I was also not prepared to accept the Accused’s version of events, which was that there were 2 encounters between the parties over brooms and that during the second encounter, PW6 had suddenly attacked the Accused and tried to strangle him and the Accused had cut PW6’s lip accidently when he tried to defend himself. Subsequently PW6 and 3 other persons had attacked the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Accused intended hurt to result from his action or knew that it was likely that hurt would result from his action</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    In the present case, I would agree with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference was that the Accused had intended to cause hurt or that he knew that his action was likely to cause hurt to PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    The Accused had given evidence that he was holding onto the scraper in his right hand and holding onto the broom in his left hand just before the incident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_578" id="Ftn_578_1"><sup>[note: 578]</sup></a></span>. His story was that he had forgotten that the scraper was in his hand when the incident happened.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    I would agree with the Prosecution that it was evident from Exhibits P5(f) and P5(g) that the scraper was not a small item but an item of significant length. The scraper was a solid and heavy piece of tool with a solid metal blade which was used to scrape things from floor tiles. Given all these, I would agree with the Prosecution that it was quite incredulous that the Accused could momentarily forget that he was holding onto such an instrument when he was confronting PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    I also agreed with the Prosecution’s observation that shortly after the incident, when interviewed by the police officers at the scene, the Accused had claimed that he could not recall the details of his scuffle with PW6 and he had also refused to answer the police when asked if any weapon was used during the scuffle. PW8 had testified that he had asked the Accused several times about the details of the scuffle, but the Accused claimed that he could not recall what had happened.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    In this regard, I also noted that the Accused had also given a one-sided view of events to DW5 who had examined him at the hospital. The Accused also did not inform DW5 that he had cut the lip of PW6 with a metal scraper during their scuffle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    I also agreed with the Prosecution’s observation that in court, when asked why he did not tell the police the truth, the Accused could not provide a logical explanation. The Accused initially claimed that the police officer did not ask him how the incident took place, before alleging that he was asked the questions in a “very fast manner”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    Given the above, I would agree with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference was that at all material times, the Accused knew that he was holding the scraper in his right hand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    On the issue of whether the Accused had intended to use the scraper on PW6, I would agree with the Prosecution that the manner that the scraper was thrusted towards PW6’s mouth clearly suggested a deliberate act of aggression, rather than accidental or defensive in nature. PW6 had testified that the Accused had suddenly pushed his right hand, which was holding the scraper, in a fast upward motion towards PW6’s mouth.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    The Accused had also in his long statement (Exhibit P10) at [3], said that he and PW6 were both tugging at the broom, during which PW6 pushed him, and he retaliated by swinging his right hand, which was holding a scraper, towards PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    If the Accused had just wanted to push PW6 away, he could have just pushed his hand straight towards the PW6 in order to do that. There was no need for the Accused to swing his hand in an upward manner towards PW6’s face. The Accused’s action clearly showed that he was swinging the scraper at PW6 and he was aiming at PW6’s head. Such actions would strongly suggest an intention to cause hurt to PW6 at his head area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    Given the above, I would agree with the Prosecution that the manner and target area of the attack (i.e. the face) which was a vulnerable part of the body, clearly pointed to the fact that the Accused had intended to cause hurt to the PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Accused can rely on Private Defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    Section 97 of the Penal Code provides the right of private defence:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>“Right of Private Defence of the body and of property</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>97</b>.    Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in sections 98 and 106A, to defend —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Extent to which right may be exercised</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>98.</b>—(1)    The right of private defence does not extend to the inflicting of more harm than it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is reasonable opportunity to have recourse to the protection of a public authority in the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="center"> <em>Illustrations</em> </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)     <em>Z</em> ambushes <em>A</em> in a secluded area and attempts to kill <em>A</em>. <em>A</em> kills <em>Z</em> while fending off <em>Z</em>’s attack. <em>A</em> is guilty of no offence because, in the circumstances, <em>A</em> had no reasonable opportunity to have recourse to the protection of a public authority.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)     <em>Z</em> ambushes <em>A</em> in a secluded area and attempts to kill <em>A</em>. <em>A</em>’s right of private defence arises because, at that point of time, <em>A</em> had no reasonable opportunity to have recourse to the protection of a public authority.

VK Rajah JA, in delivering the grounds of decision of the court, had stated at [46]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>“46</em>      <em>We would also add that, on a more faithful rendition of ss 96–106 of the Penal Code, a modified sequence of the conjunctive requirements which must be satisfied in order to establish the general exception of the right to private defence of the body (as adapted from Yeo, Morgan &amp; Chan ([14] supra) at para 20.48) is as follows:</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)     <em>Save for the situation where the defender is defending himself against an act of a person of unsound mind (see s 98 of the Penal Code), the defender must show that an offence affecting the human body has been committed or is reasonably apprehended.

This is to conform to the second precondition stated at [39] above, viz, s 99(3) of the Penal Code. The test for whether the defender had time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities is an objective one. In this regard, it should be noted that the Indian cases appear, quite correctly, to equate the words “time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities” (see s 99(3) of the Penal Code) with “reasonable opportunity of redress by recourse to the public authorities” (see Law of Crimes ([16] supra) at p 406). Further, the defender should not be expected to seek the protection of the public authorities if the time needed to do so would result in the mischief being completed (see The Indian Penal Code ([37] supra) at p 459).</em> </p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)     <em>If the defender was the aggressor at the material time, it is prima facie less likely that he had a right of private defence (cf the Indian position, which seemingly makes no room at all for a defender/aggressor to invoke this right (see [44] above; see also The Indian Penal Code at p 411)).

Much would depend on the factual matrix of the case: if, for instance the defender was armed with a deadly weapon from the outset, it was very unlikely that the right of private defence would ever arise.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    In the present case, I would agree with the Prosecution that the Accused would not be able to rely on the private defence for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_234-p2_a"></a>(a)      <u>There was no offence committed by PW6 on the Accused’s body</u>. The Accused was the one who had attacked PW6 first by using his metal scraper to cut PW6’s lip while they were tugging over the broom. PW6 then reacted by grabbing the Accused in his neck in his own defence. There was also no evidence that the Accused was attacked by 3 other workers after his encounter with PW6.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_234-p2_b"></a>(b)      <u>The Accused was the initial aggressor at the material time</u>. As the Accused was the aggressor, it was prima facie less likely that he would have a right to private defence. Moreover, in the present case, the Accused was armed with a metal scraper while PW6 was unarmed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_234-p2_c"></a>(c)      <u>The Accused had also inflicted more harm than necessary for the purpose of any alleged self- defence</u>. In the present case, even if PW6 had pushed the Accused, that did not justify the Accused’s use of a metal scraper to cut PW6’s lip. It was clear to me that the harm caused by the Accused was excessive and unreasonable given the circumstances. I would agree with the Prosecution that it was fortuitous that PW6 did not suffer any injuries which were more serious. If the Accused’s hand had gone higher, he could have caused injuries to PW6’s eye or other part of the head.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    In <em>Public Prosecutor v Liew Kim Choo</em> [1997] 3 SLR 699, Yong Pung How CJ in quoting Lord Diplock in the leading case of <em>Haw Tua Tau v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/38551-M.xml')">[1981] 2 MLJ 49</a> [at 57]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“57.  As Lord Diplock stated in the leading case of <em>Haw Tua Tau v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/38551-M.xml')">[1981] 2 MLJ 49</a> :</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">“For reasons that are inherent in the adversarial character of criminal trials under the common law system, it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then already satisfied its beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Indeed it would run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court to do so.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">58.    The prosecution must, at the end of trial, go beyond what it must show as the close of the prosecution’s case. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the prosecution need only raise a prima facie case which, if uncontradicted by the defence, would justify a conviction. That case could be made out of proved facts or reasonable inferences drawn from the proved facts. The nature of the inferences as to the primary facts must be drawn at the close of the prosecution’s case were described by Lord Diplock in <em>Haw Tua Tau</em> as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">“for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s 189(1) the court must act on the presumption (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">59.    For obvious reasons, in deciding the issue of guilt at the close of the trial, this standard will not suffice. The evidence must be subjected to the highest not lowest standard of scrutiny. The facts proved by the prosecution must therefore satisfy the trial judge beyond reasonable doubt that the correct inference to be drawn from those facts is that the accused person is guilty. The trial judge is not allowed to act on the presumption that the primary evidence is true. Nor is he to make only a minimal assessment – to decide if the necessary inferences “would reasonably be drawn”. He must make a maximum assessment…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">60.    I therefore had to consider the evidence afresh, without reference to my conclusions in the first appeal, which conclusions were premises on a different standard of proof”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    The issue of burden of proof was also considered in the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syed Mallik</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/54044-M.xml')">[2007] SGCA 48</a> where the Court of Appeal [ at 34] commented:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“34    …in relation to the requisite burden of proof, it needs no reminding that the burden lies squarely with the Prosecution to prove the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As Rajah JA said in <em>Sakthivel Punithavathi</em> ([32] supra at [78]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">Whatever is thought about the myriad objectives of criminal punishment, one fundamental principle has been hailed as a cornerstone both at common law and in the Evidence Act (Cap 97 1997 Rev Ed): before an accused can be convicted of a crime, his guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This bedrock principle is sacrosanct in our criminal justice system and constitutes a fundamental right that the courts in Singapore have consistently emphasised and upheld as a necessary prerequisite for any legitimate and sustainable conviction: see, for example, <em>Jagatheesan</em> [[66] supra]; … <em>Took Leng How v PP</em> [2006] 2 SLR (R) 70.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, the trial judge also alluded to this important principle in his judgment in respect of the second trial (see <em>Mohammed Liton (No. 2)</em> ([30] supra)). At [4] of that judgment, he stated that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">Unlike civil cases, where the court may choose between competing stories and accept the one on a balance of probabilities, that is to say, accepting that version because it seemed more plausible than the other, in a criminal case, there is an important norm to be taken into account at all times – that where there is a reasonable doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused. <em>It is inherent (in) the requirements that the prosecution proves its case beyond reasonable doubt.</em> [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">35.    As to what proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” (per Rajah JA in <em>Sakthivel Punithavathi</em> ([32] supra) at [78] means, we would endorse the definition accepted by him in <em>Jagatheesan</em> 9[32] supra at [55]), viz, the description <b>of “reasonable doubt“ as “reasoned doubt” [emphasis in original ] – which in turn mandates that all doubt, for which there is a reason relatable to and supported by the evidence present, be taken into account in favour of the accused</b>. Reasonable doubt might also arise by virtue of lack of evidence submitted, if such evidence is necessary to support the Prosecution’s theory of guilt: see <em>Jagatheesan</em> at [61]. Indeed, the trial judge also similarly referred to such a meaning of the standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” in his judgment in respect of the second trial (see <em>Mohammed Liton (No 2)</em> ([30] supra at [41]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"> <b>What this means is that unlike a civil case, the court’s verdict might not merely be determined on the basis that as between two competing stories, which version was the more plausible one. In a criminal case, the court may find … the complainant’s story to be more probable than that of the accused person’s version, and yet, be convinced that there is a reasonable possibility that the accused’s person’s story could be true. If that were the case, the court’s duty is to acquit</b>. Unlike a civil case, the court need not make a decision by concentrating on which one of the two versions was more probable. In a criminal trial the court must remind itself to break away from any habitual inclination to contemplate the question of the burden of proof on the basis of a civil case, and instead, ask itself whether there is a reasonable possibility that the accused person’s version was true. (emphasis mine)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    In the present case, having considered all the evidence before me, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proven their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I accordingly convicted the Accused of the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues raised by the Defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    I also wished to address some of the issues raised by the Defence in their closing submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_579" id="Ftn_579_1"><sup>[note: 579]</sup></a></span> :-</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_238-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Defence had alleged that there were issues with the way the police had investigated the matter. The Defence had suggested that PW7 had failed to properly investigate the matter and that he had decided that the Accused was guilty of an offence at a very early stage of investigation and he had failed to conduct a thorough investigation in order to determine exactly what had happened. In this regard, the Defence had given the following examples:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_238-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       PW7 had decided to place the Accused under arrest even before he had completed his investigation.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_238-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       PW7 did not properly investigate the cause of the Accused’s neck injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_238-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Defence also alleged that PW7 had committed the following mistakes when he recorded the Accused’s cautioned and long statements:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_238-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       PW7 had failed to explain the Charge and Notice of Warning to the Accused when he recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_238-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       PW7 had recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement before he recorded the Accused’s long statement.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_238-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       PW7 had recorded the Accused’s statements in English without any interpreter present when the Accused was unable understand or to read or write English.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_238-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       PW7 had also wrongly recorded what the Accused had told him, and he had also failed to record down some things which the Accused had told him during the taking of the statements. Also, PW7 had also added things into the Accused’s statement which was not said by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_238-p2_b-p3_v"></a>(v)       PW7 had also failed to read and explain to the Accused in Mandarin what he had recorded from the Accused and he had also failed to allow the Accused to make amendments to both his cautioned and long statements.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_238-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Defence also took issue with the fact that PW7 had failed to record his initial interview with the Accused, which interview was conducted before he recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement and long statement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239     <u>With regard to the way the police had conducted their investigations</u>, I noted that PW7 had conferred with some of the police officers who had responded to the First Information Report P1 (including PW4, PW8 and ASP Paulus) before deciding to place the Accused under arrest. The officers at the scene had also interviewed the parties involved and the witnesses before giving their feedback to PW7 before he ordered the arrest of the Accused. It was clear to me that this was not a case that PW7 had decided to place the Accused under arrest summarily without doing any investigation works.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    As regard to the Accused’s injuries, although PW7 had given evidence that he did not notice any injuries on the Accused’s neck when he recorded the Accused’s statements, I noted that PW7 had recorded a witness statement from DW3 on 22 October 2018 and DW3 had informed PW7 that he had seen bruises on the Accused’s neck and he had taken photographs of the Accused’s injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    While investigations were conducted by PW7, who was the investigating officer, the investigation papers with all the findings and exhibits (including evidence relating to the Accused’s injuries) would have to be submitted to the Attorney General’s Chambers when they were completed in order for the Public Prosecutor to decide whether to charge the Accused in court. The job of the investigation officer, PW7, was to collate all the evidence and to make recommendations to the Public Prosecutor and the Public Prosecutor was the final authority in deciding whether to charge the Accused in court for any offence. The Public Prosecutor would also have to study all the evidence that have been collected before coming to any decision to charge the Accused in court for the relevant offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    In the present case, other than the bare allegations made by the Defence, I have not seen objective evidence to suggest that the whole process from investigation to charging the Accused in court had been compromised in any way by what PW7 had allegedly failed to do. As such, I was of the view that these were bare and baseless allegations. I was also of the view that this was an unnecessary attack on the integrity of PW7 by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243     <u>As for the Accused’s ability to read and understand the English language</u>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_243-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused had claimed that he was unable to speak or understand English and was uncomfortable to have his statements recorded by PW7 in English but PW7 had proceeded to do the same. The Accused had also alleged that he had never told PW7 that he was comfortable for his long statement to be recorded in English during the recording of his long statement. The Accused had also alleged that he had no idea what was recorded in his statements as he had zero proficiency in English.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_243-p2_b"></a>(b)     Having observed the Accused’s demeanour during the trial, I was unable to accept the Accused’s contention that he was not able to speak or understand the English language. During the trial, I had observed the Accused reading the exhibits that were placed before him when he was asked questions relating to the exhibits<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_580" id="Ftn_580_1"><sup>[note: 580]</sup></a></span>. I had also observed, on several occasions, the Accused listening to his counsel’s and the learned Prosecutor’s questions which were asked in English and answering their questions even before they were translated into Mandarin by the court interpreter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_581" id="Ftn_581_1"><sup>[note: 581]</sup></a></span>. The Accused had also given his answer on one occasion in the English language. All these had happened both during his examination-in-chief as well as during cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_582" id="Ftn_582_1"><sup>[note: 582]</sup></a></span>. This clearly showed that the Accused was able to read and understand English. My observation of the Accused was quite different from what he was trying to portray to the court, that he was unable to understand the English language at all and he only knew one or two words such as “yes” or “no”.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_243-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Accused had also alleged that PW7 had failed to properly explain the charge and the Notice of Warning to him when he was recording the Accused’s cautioned statement. PW7 had, in his EIC, testified that he had explained the charge and Notice of Warning to the Accused. During cross-examination, PW7 also said that he had read and translated the charge and Notice of Warning line by line to the Accused and asked the Accused if he understood and the Accused had acknowledged that he understood both. The Defence submitted that PW7 had failed to ask the Accused to repeat back to him to check if the Accused really understood. The Defence was of the view that view that there was a significant difference between merely reading a charge to the Accused and explaining the charge to the Accused and that merely asking the Accused if he understood the charge was insufficient to proof that he had understood the charge. With due respect, I would disagree with the Defence on this point. I was unable to see the difference between “reading and translating the charge in Mandarin” and “explaining the charge in Mandarin” in that situation.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_243-p2_d"></a>(d)     PW7 was effectively bilingual and this was not disputed by the Defence. When a person has translated something line by line in Mandarin to another person and the person to whom it was translated acknowledged that he understood the translation, that clearly showed that that person had understood what was being explained to him. I also noted that when PW7 was called as a rebuttal witness, he gave evidence that he did read and explain both the charge and the Notice of Warning to the Accused. I also noted that the Accused had, in the course of his testimony, confirmed that his cautioned statement was accurately recorded, and he understood the nature of the charge after it was read and explained to him.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_243-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Accused’s cautioned statement also showed that the Accused knew that “whatever he needed to inform the Court” was recorded at page 3 of the cautioned statement (Exhibit P9) and that clearly corroborated PW7’s testimony that the notice of warning was administered to the Accused, and that he understood the same.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244     <u>As for PW7’s recording of the Accused’s long statement</u>, the Accused had made the following allegations against PW7:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_244-p2_a"></a>(a)     PW7 had failed to read and explain the statement to the Accused in Mandarin after he recorded the statement and he also did not give the Accused a chance to amend his statement.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_244-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused alleged that in the recording of his long statement, the Accused did not use the word “retaliate” but PW7 had recorded the word “retaliate” in his long statement. The Accused also alleged that he did not use the word “I threw a punch” but PW7 had recorded those words in his long statement. The Accused also said that he told PW7 that he had forgotten that he was holding onto the metal scraper and he did not have the intention to cause hurt to PW7 but PW7 had failed to record all these into his long statement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245     <u>As for PW7’s recording of the Accused’s cautioned statement</u>, the Accused had made the following allegations against PW7:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_245-p2_a"></a>(a)     PW7 had failed to read and explain the charge to the Accused before he recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_245-p2_b"></a>(b)     PW7 also did not read and explain the Notice of Warning to the Accused before he recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_245-p2_c"></a>(c)     After PW7 had recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement, he did not read and explain the statement back to the Accused in Mandarin and he also did not give the Accused a chance to amend the statement</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_245-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Accused had informed PW7 during the recording that he was strangled by PW6 and that he was beaten up by 3 other workers. However, PW7 had failed to record all these into his cautioned statement.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_245-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Accused had told PW7 that he did not hurt PW6 intentionally but PW7 had failed to record this into his cautioned statement. Instead, PW7 told the Accused that he could go to court and tell the judge if he had anything to say.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    PW7 had had given evidence that he had explained the charge and the Notice of Warning to the Accused before he started recording the Accused’s cautioned statement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    PW7 had also testified that he had recorded everything that the Accused had told him and he had translated whatever he had recorded in Mandarin to the Accused for both the statements and the Accused had agreed to what was recorded before he went on to sign his statements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    PW7 had also testified that he had also invited the Accused to make amendments to his statements in both the statements, but the Accused did not wish to make any amendments to the same.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    Given that the Accused was able to read and understand English, I found it difficult to believe that if PW7 had failed to record anything that the Accused had told PW7 in any of the statements, that the Accused would not have requested him to correct that position.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    I noted that both the Accused’s statements were recorded on 15 October 2017 and the Accused was charged in court on 16 October 2017. The Accused was assigned pro-bono counsel on 20 February 2018 and the matter was fixed for hearing starting 8 November 2018. Although the Accused was not given his long statement prior to trial, he was given a copy of his cautioned statement much earlier on. I also noted that even though the Accused had been assigned counsel to represent him, he had never raised the fact that the charge and Notice of Warning were not properly explained to him, that PW7 had failed to interpret to him in Mandarin to him what was recorded, that PW7 had not failed to record the fact that there were 3 other workers who had attacked him and that PW7 had fail to allow him to make any correction or amendments to his cautioned statement before the matter went to trial. The Accused had also not raised these issues in his Case for the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    PW7 was merely carrying out his job as an investigation officer. PW7 had also not seen the Accused before he was assigned to investigate this matter. There was also no history of bad blood between the two of them. There was no reason for PW7 to want to get the Accused into trouble by doing all those things as alleged by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    Given the above, I would agree with the Prosecution that these were all afterthoughts raised by the Accused after he had realised that there were statements recorded from him which could hurt him in his defence of the matter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253     <u>As for PW7 recording the Accused’s cautioned statement before his long statement</u>, I noted that there were no provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code which had stipulated that the Accused’s cautioned statement could only be recorded after the Accused’s long statement had been recorded.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254     <u>As for PW7 not recording the Accused’s first interview</u>, I accepted PW7’s explanation that after the initial oral interview, he did not immediately put everything down in a long statement format because he was called to respond to another case. Consequently, PW7 decided to record the Accused’s cautioned statement first (which took relatively less time) and to record the Accused’s long statement later. I also agreed with the Prosecution that during the subsequent recording of his long statement, the Accused did not add anything to what he had said earlier that day.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    I also agreed with the Prosecution that there were sufficient grounds to arrest the Accused for an offence under section 324 of the Penal Code, and the arrest was in accordance with the procedure under section 17 of the CPC, when an arrestable offence was suspected. In the present case, the police officers at the scene had interviewed both parties and witnesses.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    It was also very clear that PW6 had informed the police that the Accused had cut his lip with a metal scraper. The Accused, on the other hand, had claimed that he could not recall any detail relating to the incident despite being questioned several times by the responding officers. The Accused also refused to answer the police when asked if any weapon was used during the scuffle. Given all these, I would agree with the Prosecution that was sufficient reasonable grounds for the police to believe that the Accused had committed the said offence and to arrest the Accused and report the matter to the Public Prosecutor under section 17(1)(b) of the CPC.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257     <u>The Defence also alleged that there were material inconsistencies in the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses:</u> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_257-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Defence had submitted that there were material inconsistencies between the evidence of PW5 and PW6 in that PW5 had testified that PW6 and the Accused were hugging each other and rolling on the ground whereas PW6 had testified that they never fell to the ground.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_257-p2_b"></a>(b)     I agreed with the Defence that there were inconsistencies in the evidence of PW5 and PW6 and I was prepared to accept PW5’s evidence that both PW6 and the Accused had fallen onto the ground as PW5 was an independent witness who had nothing to gain from his appearance in court. However, I did not share the Defence’s views that such an inconsistency was material in nature. I would agree with the Prosecution that the inconsistency was a minor/immaterial inconsistency which was not fatal to PW6’s credibility. What was more material about PW5’s evidence was the fact that he had made his way to the scene in less than one minute after he heard the commotion and he did not see any other workers attacking the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_257-p2_c"></a>(c)     Regarding PW8’s inability to recall what the Accused had told him at the scene, I would agree with the Prosecution that this should not be held against PW8 in assessing his credibility as human fallibility in recollection was common and understandable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258     <u>On the issue of PW6 not being a honest witness</u>, I agreed with the Prosecution that PW6 had come clean on his role in the incident and he did admit that he had either held or grabbed the accused by the neck and had pushed him after he realised he had been cut by the metal scraper. As for PW6 not answering PW4’s questions relating to the Accused’s injuries, I agreed with the Prosecution that nothing would turn on that. I accept that PW6 would have been concentrating on his own injuries and he would not be paying any attention to the Accused’s injuries which were minor compared to his injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Accused’s antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    I noted that the Accused did not have any criminal antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Prosecution’s sentencing position</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    The Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least seven months’ imprisonment for the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable sentencing framework </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    In determining the appropriate sentence, the Prosecution pointed out that the High Court in <em>Ng Soon Kim v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24571-SSP.xml')">[2020] 3 SLR 1097</a> (“<em>Ng Soon Kim</em>”) had adopted a three-step sentencing approach (at [12]):</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_261-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, an indicative starting point would be derived based on the seriousness of the injury caused to the victim i.e., the indicative sentence if the charge had been under s 323 of the Penal Code. Notably, where minor lacerations or abrasions are caused (i.e., “low harm”), the indicative sentencing range were fines or short custodial term up to four weeks, and where “moderate harm” was caused, the indicative sentencing range was between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment (<em>Ng Soon Kim</em> at [13]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_261-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the indicative starting point should be adjusted upwards for the dangerous means used. In this regard, an uplift of six months’ imprisonment was imposed in <em>Ng Soon Kim</em> (at [16]) for the use of an ignited aerosol spray, and in <em>PP v Muhammad Syafiq bin Mohamed Abbas</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24469-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 114</a> (“<em>Muhammad Syafiq</em>”) (at [42]) for the use of a multi-purpose knife.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_261-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the Court should calibrate the final sentence according to the various aggravating and mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_262"></a>262    In the present case, the Prosecution highlighted that the Accused had inflicted a deep laceration on PW6’s right upper lip with a cement scraper, which was a sharp instrument capable of causing serious injuries. The horrific nature of the injury was self-evident from the photograph exhibit. Considering that PW6’s injury was of greater severity than the injuries classified under “low harm” (e.g. minor laceration), the Prosecution submitted that the starting point should be an imprisonment term of at least four weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263"></a>263    The second step was to consider a suitable uplift for the dangerous means used. In <em>Muhammad Syafiq</em>, where the offender was charged under section 326 of the Penal Code for stabbing the victim’s chest with a multi-purpose knife, the Court (in applying the sentencing approach in <em>Ng Soon Kim</em>) imposed an uplift of six months’ imprisonment after considering the inherently dangerous nature of the knife that was used. The Court opined (at [42]) that if an ignited aerosol stream in <em>Ng Soon Kim</em> could attract an uplift of six months’ imprisonment, the uplift for a multi-purpose knife should (in the ordinary course of things) be pegged at no less than that.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a>264    Considering the aforesaid, the Prosecution submitted that a similar uplift of at least six months’ imprisonment to the starting point should be imposed in this case where the weapon used was a sharp instrument capable of causing serious injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a>265    For the third step, the Prosecution submitted that there were no mitigating factors in this case. The lack of premeditation in this case only amounted to the absence of an aggravating circumstance, and not the existence of a mitigating circumstance (<em>PP v BDB</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> at [63]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a>266    The Prosecution submitted that the present case contained the following aggravating factors that warranted a deterrent sentence:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_266-p2_a"></a>(a)      <u>The assault on PW6 was vicious</u>: The viciousness of the assault on PW6 was evident from the deep laceration the Accused had inflicted on PW6’s right upper lip, and his targeting of a vulnerable part of PW6’s body i.e., the face. Further, it was outrageous for the Accused to hit PW6 on the mouth with a cement scraper over a mere broom. The Prosecution submitted that general deterrence was a dominant sentencing principle in such cases of violent offences, as it was necessary to signal that the law should not condone violence as a solution to problems, no matter how personal they might be, or how angry or justified one might feel (<em>PP v BPK</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22600-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 755</a> at [11]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_266-p2_b"></a>(b)      <u>Public disquiet</u>: The assault had taken place at a construction worksite, in the presence of many co-workers and would have resulted in public disquiet, which was an aggravating factor that warranted a deterrent sentence (<em>PP v Law Aik Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> at [25(c)]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_267"></a>267    Given the aggravating factors in the present case, the absence of mitigating factors, and the need for general deterrence, the Prosecution submitted that an appropriate sentence for the section 324 offence would be at least seven months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_268"></a>268    The Prosecution also highlighted that their proposed sentence was at the lower end of the range of imprisonment terms imposed in section 324 cases involving the use of sharp weapons. The Court in <em>PP v Ong Boon Sim</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22494-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 308</a> at [24] had observed that the sentences imposed for such cases were usually between six months and three-and-a-half years. The Prosecution therefore submitted that their proposed sentence was not manifestly excessive.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_269"></a>269    In conclusion, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least seven months’ imprisonment was appropriate for the proceeded charge against the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_583" id="Ftn_583_1"><sup>[note: 583]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_270"></a>270    The Defence submitted that the Accused deeply regretted his actions and was pleading for leniency. In particular, the Defence urged me to consider the following factors:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_270-p2_a"></a>(a)     Compassionate grounds;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_270-p2_b"></a>(b)     No antecedents; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_270-p2_c"></a>(c)     Evidence of good character.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">A.   Compassionate grounds</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_271"></a>271    The Defence highlighted that the Accused had worked for Tian Di Engineering Pte Ltd since December 2016. The Accused was the primary caregiver for family who resided in China. He had two aging parents who relied solely on his income for their survival. The Accused’s wife was unemployed. He also had a 15-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son, both of whom were still schooling.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_272"></a>272    Given the above, the Defence submitted that a long custodial sentence for the Accused would leave his family in a precarious situation as they would be left without his income.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_273"></a>273    Additionally, the Accused had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the Accused was infected by the virus while living in one of the largest foreign worker dormitories in Singapore. In August 2020, he was moved from the foreign worker dormitory to his work site dormitory. However, the impact of contracting the COVID-19 virus still caused him body aches and pains, making it difficult for him to work to support his family.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">B.   No previous antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_274"></a>274    The Accused was untraced and had no prior convictions<em>.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">C.   Evidence of good character</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_275"></a>275    The Defence submitted that the Accused’s offence, which he deeply regretted, was out of character</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_276"></a>276    The Defence had received a glowing testimonial from his employer which had testified for his good character. The testimonial pointed to the Accused’s high social standing amongst his peers and co-workers and the present incident was totally out of character for him and not reflective of him as a person<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_584" id="Ftn_584_1"><sup>[note: 584]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">D.   Loss of employment</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_277"></a>277    The Defence submitted that it was trite law that a loss of employment is a mitigating factor. In <em>Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1992] 1 SLR(R) 0523.xml')">[1992] 1 SLR(R) 523</a>, the court had emphasized that loss of employment, all related financial benefits and career progression are part of the circumstances that the court would consider in assessing sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_278"></a>278    In the present case, the Accused’s employers had indicated that they were prepared to continue employing the Accused if his employment pass could be renewed, given his consistent work performance over many years. However, a conviction in this case was likely to affect the Accused’s ability to continue working in Singapore. The Defence urged me to consider the likely loss of employment as a strong mitigating factor.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence’ Submission on Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_279"></a>279    The Defence had submitted for a sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment. The Defence was of the view that the sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment would be consistent and congruent with recent case law and appropriate given the Accused’s circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_280"></a>280    The Defence had tendered the following sentencing precedents in support of their sentencing proposal:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="9.36%"/> <col width="69.14%"/> <col width="21.5%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S/No</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Case Name and Description</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>Public Prosecutor v Jamie Chen Xin Yi</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24214-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 47</a> (“<b><em>Jamie Chen</em></b>”)</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Accused used a penknife with a blade measuring about 7cm in length to slash the victim once on his chest, causing him to sustain a linear vertical superficial laceration measuring 22cm in length on his chest.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- The accused did not lose her self-control but slashed the victim quite deliberately as seen from the <b>long laceration which required sustained pressure</b>.</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>PP v Ong Boon Sim</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22494-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 308</a> (“<b><em>Ong Boon Sim</em></b>”)</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- As the accused walked past the victim’s table, the victim uttered vulgarities and made offending remarks at the accused.

As such, the indicative starting sentence should be no more than 4 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_283"></a>283    In considering a suitable uplift, the Defence submitted that the weapon used by the Accused in the present case was a cement scraper and a cement scraper was not ordinarily used for cutting or stabbing. While the cement scraper was still inherently dangerous, the uplift should be less than that of sharp and long instruments such as knives and cutting instruments. As such, the Defence was of a view that an uplift of <b>4 months</b> would be appropriate in the present circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_284"></a>284    Finally, with regard to calibrating the sentence, the Defence submitted that the Accused was a first-time offender and that factor should be given much weight. Taken in totality, the Defence was of the view that an appropriate sentence for the present case is not more than 5 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_285"></a>285    The Defence also noted that the Prosecution had put forth the following aggravating factors which warranted a deterrent sentence, specifically:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_285-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the assault on PW6 was vicious; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_285-p2_b"></a>(b)     That there was public disquiet.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286"></a>286    The Defence disagreed with the aggravating factors. The Defence noted that while the Prosecution had cited the case of <em>PP v BPK (“BPK”)</em> for the proposition that general deterrence was the dominant sentencing principle in cases of violent offences, the case of <em>BPK</em> related to a charge under section 307 Penal Code for attempted murder causing hurt. In the present case, the charge related to one of causing hurt with a dangerous weapon where the sentencing considerations were wholly different than that in <em>BPK</em><b>.</b></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_287"></a>287    Further, while the assault on PW6 did result in a deep laceration on PW6’s right upper lip, the Defence submitted that it would be presumptuous to label it as vicious when the Accused himself had also suffered superficial excoriations from PW6’s grabbing of his throat.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_288"></a>288    Additionally, the Accused only committed a single act leading to the laceration on PW6’s right upper lip. In contrast, in the case of <em>Hamid</em>, the accused had stabbed his wife 24 times at various parts of her body. The victim in <em>Hamid</em> had suffered 24 lacerations. The number of attacks was a factor to be taken into account by the courts when determining the viciousness of the attack. The Defence felt that it was an exaggeration to call a single attack by the Accused vicious.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_289"></a>289    Secondly, in the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/52531-M.xml')">[2007] SGHC 33</a>, the court had held that certain crimes, in addition to harming their immediate victims, also had the wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public. Thus, a deterrent sentence was necessary and appropriate to quell public disquiet and the unease engendered by such crimes. The Defence submitted that a fight taking place in a construction site could not be said to “<em>offend the sensibilities of the general public</em>” when the case of <em>Law Aik Meng</em> was referring to crimes such as bribery which would concern the wider public, or offences which involved a public institution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_290"></a>290    In addition, the Defence submitted that a fight occurring at one floor of a construction site was a different scenario from a fight which had occurred at, for instance, a “<em>busy road intersection</em>”, such as in the case of <em>Ng Soon Kim</em>, where that “<em>might have given rise to some public alarm</em>”. The number of people who could potentially have seen such a fight was limited to the construction workers who would have had access to the construction site, as opposed to the general public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_291"></a>291    The Defence submitted that the Accused was truly repentant and remorseful for what he has done. The Accused also assured the Court that he would not commit any offences again.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_292"></a>292    Based on the reasons stated above, the Defence urged me to temper justice with compassion by imposing a sentence of not more than 5 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">My Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_293"></a>293    The punishment prescribed under section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) was imprisonment for a term which could extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing principles under section 324 Penal Code</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_294"></a>294    In <b><em>Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23676-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 247</a> 216 (“<b><em>Ng Soon Kim</em></b>”) at [12]– [13], the Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon had laid out the steps that a sentencing court should take when dealing with a section 324 Penal Code case:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“12     <em>In these circumstances, I approached the task of arriving at an appropriate sentence for an offence under s 324 in the following manner.

In the absence of exceptional circumstances, imprisonment is the norm. The actual length of the sentence turns on the unique facts of each case. The obvious aggravating factors would be <b>premeditation, a lengthy application of violence, group assault, serious injuries, the use of a deadly weapon, or wicked means like fire, corrosive substance or poison, and previous convictions</b>.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_296"></a>296    In applying the principles as laid down in <em>Ng Soon Kim</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Step 1 - The notional starting sentence had this been a case under section 323 Penal Code</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_297"></a>297    PW6 had suffered a deep laceration on the right upper lip involving the vermillion border and he had suffered upper lip pain and mild right supraorbital tenderness and he was given two days of medical leave<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_585" id="Ftn_585_1"><sup>[note: 585]</sup></a></span>. Exhibit P4 showed very clearly how deep the laceration was. I was of the view that the injury to PW6 was not a minor injury. If the Accused had been charged under section 323 Penal Code, this case would have fallen within the lower end of Band 2 of the sentencing framework in <em>Low Song Chye.</em> Under the first step of the <em>Ng Soon Kim</em> framework, the starting sentence should be pegged at around 1 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Step 2 - The appropriate uplift to account for the weapon used</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_298"></a>298    Under the second step of the <em>Ng Soon Kim</em> framework, I would need to give regard to the means used to inflict the injuries and the potential harm that could result from the chosen means of offending (<em>Ng Soon Kim</em> at [12]). The more inherently dangerous the weapon or means, the greater the potential harm and the higher the level of egregiousness (<em>Ng Soon Kim</em> at [11]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_299"></a>299    In the present case, the Accused had used a cement scraper as the weapon of choice. The cement scraper had a strong metal blade with a sharp edge and the metal blade was designed to scrape materials off walls and floors. The cement scraper was also very sturdy as it was made for industrial use. Given its sharp blade and its sturdy nature, I was of the view that the cement scraper was akin to a sharp cutting instrument. The cement scraper, if used as a weapon of offence, was inherently dangerous and carried great potential for harm and could even cause death. The Accused had also attacked PW6 at a vulnerable part of his body which was his head area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_300"></a>300    Give the above facts, I was of the view that a suitable uplift would be a 6 month’ uplift, given that the cement scraper was an inherently dangerous weapon. Adding this to the starting point of 1 months’ imprisonment would raise the total sentence to 7 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Step 3 - Calibration on account of mitigating and aggravating factors</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_301"></a>301    Under the third step of the <em>Ng Soon Kim</em> framework, I had taken into account the mitigation factors raised by the Accused in his Mitigation Plea. I also took into account the fact that the Accused was a first offender. However, I noted that there was no remorse on the part of the Accused in that he had decided to challenge the charge and we had to undergo 9 days of hearing for this matter. As the Accused had not pleaded guilty to the charge, the usual sentencing discount that was usually granted to a case whereby an offender had pleaded guilty would not be applicable to the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appropriate sentence in the present case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_302"></a>302    In applying the <em>Ng Soon Kim</em> framework, the appropriate sentence would be at least 7 months’ imprisonment. This was also in line with the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_303"></a>303    Having considered all the above factors, I imposed a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment on the Accused, the sentence to take effect from the date of my sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_304"></a>304    The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against my order on conviction and sentence. I had also granted a stay of execution of the sentence pending appeal and the Accused had also been granted bail pending appeal.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a
