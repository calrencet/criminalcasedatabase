id="p1_1"></a>1       The Accused, a 44-year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident, claimed trial to 24 charges under section 22A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”), for demanding or receiving varying sums, as consideration, from various foreign employees, for the employment of these foreign employees at either BS Global Engineering Services Pte Ltd (“BS Global”) or BSA Construction Pte Ltd (“BSA Construction”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Accused was represented.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 2 December 2020, I amended four of the charges, and the Prosecution and Defence were asked if they wished to recall any of the witnesses pursuant to section 131 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). Both the Prosecution and the Defence indicated that they did not wish to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 3 December 2020, I convicted the Accused on 21 of the charges, including the amended charges. The Accused was acquitted of three of the charges. After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation and address on sentence presented by the Defence, I sentenced the Accused to a total term of imprisonment of 24 weeks. In addition, the Accused was ordered to pay a penalty amounting to $48,000 (in default, 40 days’ imprisonment) on 30 December 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Accused has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the sentence is stayed pending appeal.

These 10 foreign employees are listed in paragraph 7(a) above. They testified that at various points in time, between about 7.00pm and 10.00pm, they met the Accused at the field and handed the “transfer fee” to him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     These group of foreign employees also testified that prior to 10 September 2017, they were work permit holders under the employ of BS Global. However, about a few days or a week before 10 September 2017, they found out that their work permits were cancelled/temporarily cancelled. Some of them were told by the “office staff” that BS Global was facing financial issues which resulted in their work permits being cancelled. While the Accused did not speak to them collectively, they were told by the Accused that the Accused could transfer them to his other company, BSA Construction, if they paid him a transfer fee of $1,500. The foreign employees were told about the offer when they contacted the Accused after finding out that their work permits had been cancelled/temporarily cancelled. They decided to take up the offer.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Under cross-examination, the witnesses consistently maintained that they handed $1,500 to the Accused on 10 September 2017. It was put to them that the Accused could not have been there as he was having a meeting with a client on that day at Genting Lane.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence relating to the payment of fees for employment by BS Global </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In addition to the payment of transfer fees, five of the witnesses testified that in order to be employed by BS Global, they paid the Accused a sum of money as consideration for their employment. These workers were: Hasanuzzaman (PW13), Mamun (PW8), Kabir (PW14), Hayder (PW15), and Sahanur (PW2). Other than these five workers, Aktar (PW17) and Ashfaqur made payments to the Accused as well, in order for them to secure employment at BS Global.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Hasanuzzaman testified that he met the Accused, sometime in November or December 2015, through one Habib. He had approached the Accused for a job and the Accused told him that he (Hasanuzzaman) had to pay a consideration of $3,500<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Hasanuzzaman then left for Bangladesh but conveyed through Habib that he was agreeable to paying the consideration. Eventually, Hasanuzzaman paid a total of $3,700 – an initial sum of $1,000, an additional sum of $200 (as the work permit application was initially rejected), and a balance of $2,700. On 23 April 2016, Hasanuzzaman came to Singapore to work for BS Global. Initially, he had taken instructions from the Accused’s friend as the Accused was not in Singapore. However, after the Accused returned to Singapore, Hasanuzzaman met him in the office and took instructions from the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mamun testified that he found the job at BS Global through his friend Rabiul. Rabiul told him that he (Mamun) had to pay a sum of $3,500 to the Accused for the job. Mamun agreed and paid the amount accordingly through Rabiul, when he (Mamun) was in Bangladesh. He made the payment upon receipt of his “In-Principle Approval” (“IPA”), issued by the MOM, from Rabiul who had introduced him to the job<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Under cross-examination, he candidly admitted that he did not know for a fact if Rabiul paid the Accused $3,500. When he asked the Accused about the receipt of the fees, the Accused had acknowledged receipt<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. However, Mamun did not ask the Accused the exact amount that he had received<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Kabir gave evidence that he came to know about BS Global through a friend, Tofail. Tofail told Kabir that if he wished to work for BS Global, he would have to pay a sum of $3,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. Tofail then brought him to the office where he met Navin, who informed Kabir that a sum of $1,500 would have to be paid before the application for an IPA. And after the IPA was issued, Kabir would then pay the balance of $1,500. Kabir accordingly paid $1,500 to Navin<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, and upon receipt of the IPA, paid the balance amount of $1,500 to the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Hayder testified that his brother, Hossain Tofayl (PW16), had assisted him to get the job at BS Global<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> through Sahanur<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. Hossain Tofayl gave evidence that the Accused had asked for a sum of $3,000 as consideration for Hayder’s employment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. Hossain Tofayl then informed Hayder who agreed to pay the amount in two instalments: $1,000 before the application for an IPA, and the balance of $1,900 (the amount of $2,000 was reduced to $1,900 by the Accused upon Hossain Tofayl’s request<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>) upon the receipt of the IPA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. Sometime in March 2017, Hayder paid the sums of $1,000 and $1,900 to the Accused through Hossain Tofayl<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It was the evidence of Sahanur that he enlisted the help of his friend, Kamal (PW6), to look for a job in Singapore. Kamal then recommended BS Global and said that he would bring Sahanur to meet the Accused. Sometime in December 2016, he was informed by Kamal that he (Sahanur) would need to pay the Accused a sum of $3,500 as consideration<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. Sahanur agreed and Kamal then assisted to hand a photocopy of his passport to the Accused, as Sahanur was in Bangladesh at that time. After Kamal handed the sum of $3,500 to the Accused, he called Sahanur and passed his phone to the Accused so that Sahanur could speak to the Accused directly. The Accused acknowledged receipt<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Kamal testified that he helped his friend, Sahanur, pass a sum of $3,500 to the Accused. After handing over the sum of money to the Accused, he called Sahanur and asked Sahanur to confirm the same with the Accused, by passing the phone to the Accused. Under cross-examination, he confirmed that he went with his cousin. However, with respect to the issue of Sahanur’s passport<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and the IPA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, he was unable to recall specifically.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Aktar gave evidence that his friend, Babu (PW18), recommended the Accused’s company to him when Hossain told him that he was looking for a job<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. Aktar eventually met the Accused in the office and the Accused told Aktar that he would have to pay a sum of $3,600 as consideration for employment by BS Global<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. Aktar agreed and left a copy of his passport and returned to Bangladesh<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. Subsequently, Babu forwarded Aktar’s IPA to him, and Hossain then paid $3,600 to the Accused through Babu. After the payment, Aktar spoke to the Accused who acknowledged receipt<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Babu testified and confirmed that he handed a sum of $3,600 to Navin, as told by the Accused. After handing over the cash, he called Aktar and asked the Accused and Aktar to talk to one another to confirm the receipt of the $3,600<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In relation to Ashfaqur, he was unable to return to Singapore as a result of the pandemic<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. The Prosecution sought to admit, pursuant to section 32(1)(<em>k</em>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), three statements made by Ashfaqur (P21 to P23). In P21<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and P22<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>, Ashfaqur told the recording officers that he paid a sum of $3,000 directly to the Accused so that he could work at BS Global.

They were Raju (PW3), Rakib (PW9) and Rakibul (PW12). In addition, Faruk (PW11) and Reaid (PW4) testified that they each paid a sum of $3,000 to the Accused so that they could be transferred from BS Global to BSA Construction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Raju testified that sometime in September 2017, he found out that BSA Construction was hiring. He then made a call to the Accused and met the Accused at BSA Construction. The Accused informed him that he had to pay a sum of $3,500 as consideration. Raju agreed. He then returned with his friend, Haque Mohammad Mofidul (who was also known as Sabbir) (PW5) (“Sabbir”), and managed to persuade the Accused to accept $3,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.

Rakib then went to the office with his friend, Muklesur (PW10)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. At the meeting, the Accused told Rakib that he had to pay $3,500 if he wanted to work at BSA Construction. Rakib agreed and paid an initial sum of $1,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>.

Rakibul then contacted the Accused as he was looking for a new employer. The Accused told Rakibul that he would need some time to arrange for a job and Rakibul then returned to Bangladesh. Subsequently, in April or May 2017, the Accused told Rakibul that he had to pay a sum of $8,500 as consideration for employment by BSA Construction<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.

However, about two weeks later, the Accused told Faruk that his work permit could not be reinstated and offered to transfer him from BS Global to BSA Construction instead, for a sum of $3,000. Faruk agreed as he felt that he would have to pay more to come back to work in Singapore if he were to be sent back to Bangladesh. Faruk went down to the office and handed over a sum of $3,000 to Vinisha<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.

Thereafter, IO Annabelle printed the statement for her to read to Ashfaqur<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> in Bengali. If Ashfaqur had wanted to change any portion of the statement, the amendment would be made accordingly. For example, Ashfaqur had made an amendment to paragraph one of the statement to reflect the word “Bangladesh”. After ascertaining that the statement was in order, Ashfaqur would sign first, followed by her, and then IO Annabelle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Mdm Yesmin was the interpreter for the recording of P23. She testified that she read P21 to Ashfaqur at the start of the recording of P23. In relation to the answer to “question 3”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>, Mdm Yesmin’s testimony was that P23 was printed and read to Ashfaqur in Bengali, after which, she asked Ashfaqur for his address, and IO Annabelle had then incorporated the address into the statement. As for the answer to “question 5”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>, Ashfaqur had initially said he had nothing to add, but subsequently, as the statement was being read to him in Bengali, he wanted to make an addition to the statement, and hence the answer was amended.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defence’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a <em>prima facie</em> case against the Accused and called upon the Accused to give evidence in his defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Accused elected to give evidence. He also called two defence witnesses to testify. The Accused does not dispute that the foreign workers were employees of either BS Global or BSA Construction. His defence was that he did not collect any amount from them as consideration for their employment, nor did he collect any transfer fee from them.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of the Accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Accused first came to Singapore in 1997 to work as a welder<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>. In 2007, he obtained permanent residency status in Singapore and started a company BS Marine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>. Thereafter, he became involved in BS Global and BSA Construction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In relation to the charges involving the Angullia Mosque group – the Accused denied being present in the open field on 10 September 2017. He claimed that he was with a client, Mrs Low, at Genting Lane for four hours that evening and could not possibly have been at the field<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As for the other charges – the Accused’s defence was a bare denial. He denied collecting any sum of money from any of the foreign employees as consideration for their employment by either BS Global or BSA Construction. He similarly denied collecting a transfer fee of $3,000 from Faruk or Reaid.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     To support his defence, the Accused relied on various signed declaration letters and IPAs – where it was reflected that no agency fee was paid: (i) Rana Mohammad Masud (D3 – declaration letter) (ii) Raju Tarek (D4 – IPA and D5 – declaration letter), (iii) Reaid Mohammad Majedul Islam (D10 – IPA and D11 – declaration letter), (iv) Jamil (D12 – IPA and D13 – declaration letter), (v) Mamun Abdullah (D15 – IPA), (vi) Uddin Rakib (D16 – IPA), (vii) Hossan Faruk (D21 – IPA and D24 – declaration letter), (viii) Nannu Rakibul Hasan (D26 – IPA and D29 – declaration letter), (ix) Hasanuzzaman Mohamad (D31 – IPA), (x) Hayder Rakibul (D35 – IPA), (xi) Babu Rabiul Hasan (D40 – IPA and D41 – declaration letter), (xii) Rahman Syed Mafuzur (D44 – IPA and D45 – declaration letter), and (xiii) Yousuf (D48 – IPA and D50 – declaration letter).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Accused also relied on various letters purportedly signed by a handful of workers, stating that they wished to withdraw their case against the Accused and Navin, and that they were instigated by a “co-worker” to make false allegations against the company (“the withdrawal letters”): (i) Hasanuzzaman Mohamad (D32) (ii) Hossain Md Aktar (D39), (iii) Rahman Syed Mafuzur (D47), and (iv) Yousuf (D51).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     A letter written by one Chandra Moorthy was also produced (D54) – in that letter, the maker claimed that he has met all the workers and that they had admitted to making false allegations in relation to the collection of agency fees against the Accused and Navin.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Defence called G Yoraju s/o Gopalakrishnan (DW2) (“Yoraju”) and Low Yit Kheong (DW3) (“Low”) to give evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of G Yoraju s/o Gopalakrishnan</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Yoraju took over as the manager of BSA Construction after the Accused resigned.

In relation to the evidence of Hayder (PW15), Sahanur (PW2) and Aktar (PW17) that they paid the Accused a sum of money for employment BS Global, the Prosecution submitted that their evidence was corroborated by the evidence of Hossain Tofayl (PW16), Kamal (PW6) and Babu (PW8) respectively. Likewise, the evidence of Raju (PW3) and Rakib (PW9) that they paid a sum of money to the Accused for employment by BSA Construction was supported by the evidence of Sabbir (PW5) and Muklesur (PW10).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Prosecution also submitted that the statements of Ashfaqur should be given full weight. The Prosecution highlighted that the three statements given by Ashfaqur were read to him, in full, with the assistance of Bengali interpreters. Ashfaqur was given an opportunity to amend his statements and the statements were given by him voluntarily<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the defence of the Accused should be rejected.

The Defence further submitted that the Accused had maintained a consistent defence throughout<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> and that his defence was corroborated by the testimonies of Yoraju (DW2)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> and Low (DW3)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Defence submitted that the Prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and that the workers had concocted the allegations against the Accused in order to prolong their stay in Singapore, upon being terminated by BS Global<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Amendment of charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     After reading the submissions by the Prosecution and the Defence, I amended the four charges pursuant to section 128(1) of the CPC. Three of the charges (MAC-903274-2018, MAC-903273-2018 and MAC-908892-2018) were amended to take into account the evidence of Hasanuzzaman (PW13), Kabir (PW14) and Rakibul (PW12).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I explained why the amendments were made to the Prosecution and the Defence – in relation to MAC-903274-2018, I amended the date in the charge to “November or December 2015” as this was the period when Hasanuzzaman met the Accused, and the Accused told him that the fee for employment by BS Global was $3,500.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     With respect to MAC-903273-2018, Kabir testified that he only paid $1,500 directly to the Accused – the balance of $1,500 was paid to “Navin”. The charge was thus amended to reflect the lower amount. In addition, I amended the date in the charge to reflect “December 2016 or January 2017” as Kabir was unable to recall if he had handed over the sums of money in December 2016, or January 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The amendment to MAC-908892-2018 pertained only to the month – it was amended to reflect the month of September as well, as it was Rakibul’s evidence that he paid the Accused a sum of $3,500 over a few instalments between August and September 2017<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In addition, I amended MAC-903260-2018 as there was a misspelling to the foreign employee’s name.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     After reading the amended charges, the Prosecution and Defence indicated that they did not wish to recall any of the witnesses.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues involved</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The present case did not involve any complicated issues of law. It premised purely on the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight to be accorded to Ashfaqur’s statements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Defence did not dispute that the workers were working for BS Global or BSA Construction at the relevant time.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Charges involving the Angullia Mosque group</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In relation to this set of charges, I accepted the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span>. The testimonies of these foreign employees remained unshaken despite lengthy and intense cross-examination by the Defence. Their evidence was textured and consistent on the events leading to the meeting at the open field. This was also not a case where they had gone to the open field outside Angullia Mosque together to meet the Accused on 10 September 2017, and had discussed the payment <em>en route</em>. Most of them had gone there individually only to find that quite a few of their colleagues were also there to meet the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span>. Some of them testified that they did not know how much money their colleagues had handed over to the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> – this showed their candour and that this was not a case where they were all out to get the Accused. There was also no evidence that these foreign employees shared such a close relationship with each other that they would collude to frame the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     While there might be some facts or details which these foreign employees were unable to recall, I recognised that their memory in relation to these might have been affected by the passage of time, as their contact with the Accused happened more than a year prior to the start of the trial. In dealing with discrepancies and/or inconsistencies of this nature, I found the observation made by Abdul Hamid J in <em>Chean Siong Guat v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/35777-M.xml')">[1969] 2 MLJ 63</a> at 64 instructive:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate needs to do is to consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies … On the other hand, if a magistrate finds the discrepancies do not detract from the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would be proper for him to regard the discrepancies as trivial and ignore them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62_1"></a>The above observation was endorsed by Yong Pung How CJ in <em>Sundara Moorthy Lankathran v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0253.xml')">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 253</a> at [40], and by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in <em>Jayasekara Arachchilage Hemantha Neranjan Gamini &amp; anor v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0689.xml')">[2011] 3 SLR 689</a> at [66]. I did not think that the credibility of these witnesses was impugned in anyway by the minor and inconsequential inconsistencies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I further rejected the Defence’s suggestion that this group of foreign employees had fabricated the payment of the $1,500 just so that they could stay on in Singapore on a special pass to work. There was no guarantee that if they remained in Singapore on a special pass, they would be able to find an alternative job under the temporary job scheme. If the case had dragged on, as did in the present case, they might end up being in Singapore for a prolonged period with no job. In any event, the alleged false report did not guarantee that they would be allowed to remain in Singapore. For example, Ashfaqur had already left Singapore at the time of the trial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I therefore accepted the foreign employee’s evidence that they had met the Accused on 10 September 2017 and had passed $1,500 to him as consideration for transfer from BS Global to BSA Construction.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Charges relating to the payment of fees for employment by BS Global</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I next considered the evidence of Hasanuzzaman (PW13), Mamun (PW8), Kabir (PW14), Hayder (PW15), Sahanur (PW2), Aktar (PW17) and Ashfaqur in relation to the payment of a sum as consideration for employment by BS Global. Apart from Ashfaqur, whose evidence was by way of statements, all the other foreign employees in this group gave evidence at the trial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I first dealt with the charge relating to Ashfaqur (MAC-903258-2018). The Prosecution was unable to secure Ashfaqur’s attendance in court and it sought to admit his statements under section 32 of the Evidence Act. The statements were admitted by consent and contained facts relevant to the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     After hearing the evidence of SIO Khairul, IO Annabelle, Mdm Yesmin and Mdm Aroti, I was of the view that it was not safe to convict the Accused on the charge based on these statements alone.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     First, I was of the view that P21 was not properly recorded – not because SIO Khairul did not discharge his duties properly, but because there were handwritten portions of the statement which were not properly accounted for. The handwritten portion in the first paragraph of the statement dated 4 October 2017 (P21) was the part which was most relevant and critical to the charge – SIO Khairul gave evidence that he was not the maker of the handwritten portion. While he said that he believed it was IO Annabelle who wrote the handwritten portion, IO Annabelle was unable to confirm it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Second, the first paragraph of P21 (including the handwritten portion) appeared inconsistent with the answer to “Q2” in P22, which was a statement given by Ashfaqur on 19 October 2017. In P21 – looking at the flow of the sentences, it would appear that Ashfaqur paid the Accused the sum of $3,000 after he had started work in mid-January 2017, while in P22, he said that he had paid the Accused in December 2016. As Ashfaqur was unable to return to Singapore, we were unable to clarify this issue with him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Third, Ashfaqur’s IPA was only approved on 28 December 2016, no explanation was given on how Ashfaqur could have returned to Singapore on 10 December 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Fourth, I did not think that P23 could cure the inadequacies in relation to the author of the handwritten portion in P21. The charge specified that Ashfaqur paid the Accused a sum of $3,000 in December 2016 – and there was insufficient evidence to establish this beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In relation to MAC-903261-2018, Mamun’s payment of $3,500 was based solely on the representation of Rabiul. Rabiul did not testify in court, and Mamun (PW8) had no direct contact with the Accused nor had he spoken personally to the Accused prior to his arrival in Singapore to work for the Accused. While Mamun testified that the Accused had acknowledged the receipt of the fees, he admitted that he did not know how much was in fact paid to the Accused, neither did he check with the Accused the amount which the Accused had received.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the circumstances, I was not satisfied that the Prosecution had proved this charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Whatever evidence which was adduced from Mamun was purely hearsay evidence. For the avoidance of doubt, this had no bearing on the credibility of Mamun in relation to his evidence on the payment of $1,500 to the Accused in the vicinity of Angullia Mosque on 10 September 2017. Mamun was a credible witness, however, his evidence in relation to MAC-903261-2018 was hearsay and therefore insufficient for the purpose of proving the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I next considered the charge in MAC-903274-2018 – it was clear from the evidence of Hasanuzzaman (PW13) that he spoke to the Accused sometime in November or December 2015 about a job, and the Accused had asked for a sum of $3,500. Although Hasanuzzaman eventually paid a total of $3,700 to the Accused through his friend Habib, there was no direct evidence that Habib had in fact paid over the full sum of $3,700 to the Accused. Hasanuzzaman had paid over the extra $200 based solely on what was represented to him by Habib, which was hearsay evidence as Habib did not testify at the trial. In the circumstances, I amended the charge in MAC-903274-2018 to reflect a sum of $3,500 instead.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     With respect to the charge in MAC-903273-2018, I accepted Kabir’s evidence that he had paid a total of $3,000 as consideration for his employment by BS Global. However, since it was his evidence that $1,500 was made to Navin and the other $1,500 was paid directly to the Accused, the charge should be amended accordingly to reflect this. In addition, the date was amended as Kabir could not recall if he had handed over the sums of money in December 2016, or January 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As for the remaining charges involving Hayder (PW15), Sahanur (PW2) and Aktar (PW17), I found the evidence of the foreign employees truthful and compelling, and their evidence was also backed by the evidence of Hossain Tofayl (PW16), Kamal (PW6) and Babu (PW18) respectively. They held firm in their evidence that they paid agency fees to the Accused despite rigorous cross-examination and I did not find that these foreign employees or their witnesses had any reason to frame the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Charges relating to the payment of fees for employment by by/transfer to BSA Construction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In relation to this set of charges, I accepted the evidence of Raju (PW3), Rakib (PW9) and Rakibul (PW12) relating to the payment of fees for employment by BSA Construction. The evidence of Raju and Rakib was further corroborated by Sabbir (PW5) and Muklesur (PW10) respectively. I also accepted the evidence of Reaid (PW4) that he had paid a sum of $3,000 to the Accused for the purpose of transferring from BS Global to BSA Construction. As noted above, the workers and their witnesses were under rigorous cross-examination by the Defence. Yet, they held their ground and remained firm that a sum of money was paid to the Accused as consideration for their employment by BSA Construction. Having made these general observations, I dealt more specifically with a couple of the charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I have originally informed parties that I was minded to amend the charge in MAC-908895-2016 involving Hossan Faruk based on his evidence that the sum of $3,000 was handed over to Vinisha sometime in August or September 2017, after he agreed to the Accused’s request for a $3,000 transfer fee. However, I subsequently informed parties that I decided not to amend it as it would not change my decision on this charge. Vinisha was not called to the stand by the Prosecution and there was no evidence in relation to what Vinisha did with the $3,000 after Faruk handed the amounts over to her. In the circumstances, I found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the Accused had received, directly or indirectly, a sum of $3,000 from Faruk.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In relation to the payment of $5,000 through Golam in the charge in MAC-908896-2018, I accepted that the payment had indeed been made. The facts in relation to this charge was different from the charge involving Mamun in MAC-903261-2018. In that case, Mamun had no direct dealings or contact with the Accused at all until he came to Singapore, unlike in Rakibul’s case, where he had spoken directly to the Accused and was told by the Accused that the fee payable would be $8,500. The Accused was chasing Rakibul for the payment of $5,000 after the IPA was send to Rakibul. The Accused also informed Rakibul, after $5,000 was paid through Golam, that Rakibul had to pay the balance in instalments, upon Rakibul’s arrival in Singapore. Based on that understanding, Rakibul paid the balance of $3,500 directly to the Accused in instalments, which the Accused accepted, when he arrived in Singapore. The irresistible inference was therefore that the Accused had received, indirectly, from Rakibul a sum of $5,000 after the IPA was sent to him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Credibility of the Accused and Yoraju </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Accused’s defence is one of bare denial. He denied demanding or collecting (directly or indirectly) any fee from the workers. I rejected the Accused’s defence as his evidence was fraught with inconsistencies and untruths. I will highlight the following examples:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_i"></a>(i)     The Accused claimed that he was not present at the open field in the evening of 10 September 2017 as he was with his client at Genting Lane. This was directly contradicted by the evidence of the foreign witnesses who were there at that time, and I found them to be truthful witnesses. There was no reason for them to lie and falsely implicate the Accused. They had nothing to gain for so doing. Further, when asked, they testified that there was no unhappiness between them and the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     The Accused called Low to the stand to support his claim that he was at PGMW with Mrs Low to, <em>inter alia</em>, settle payments. However, Low’s evidence did not lend credence to the Accused’s claim and was at best neutral. In fact, his evidence was detrimental to the Accused as he testified specifically that his wife did not handle payment issues.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     The Accused had originally said in his statement (P25) that he had gone to the workshop to meet Mr Low. P25 was admitted with the consent of the Defence. However, this morphed into a meeting with Mrs Low in the course of the trial, likely because the Accused found out that Low was actually in hospital on 10 September 2017. Even if I accepted that the Accused had made an inadvertent mistake in P25, no explanation was given as to why the Defence did not call Mrs Low to testify, if she was in fact an alibi for the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     It was put to the foreign employees that the Accused was at Genting Lane, which was in fact quite far away from the address of PGMW at Bendemeer Road. No credible explanation was given by the Accused in relation to this discrepancy, and the discrepancy between the timing that he had stated in his statement (P25) and what he had said in court.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_v"></a>(v)     By the Accused’s own breakdown of his duration at the workshop, he was probably only at the workshop for about two hours, if at all. This was quite different from the four hours that he claimed he spent at the workshop.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     The Accused suggested that the foreign employees had framed him as they were not chosen to be transferred<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span>. However, this was not put to them when they were on the stand which was contrary to the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">It seems to me to be <em>absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made</em>, and not to take his evidence and passed it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>It also did not explain why Reaid would fabricate evidence against the Accused because he was in fact transferred to BSA Construction. In addition, the Accused claimed that, at the time of the incident, it was one Mr Boominadhan who decided on the transfer of the workers. If that was the case, there was no reason for the foreign employees to frame the Accused since he was not the one who decided on whether or not they were transferred to BSA Construction<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_vii"></a>(vii)     The Defence accused Rakib of moonlighting at “Ping Form” and produced a series of WhatsApp exchanges (D18) in support of its claim. When cross-examined by the Prosecution on D18, the Accused was extremely evasive and gave various differing versions in relation to the parties who were involved in the WhatsApp exchanges. Eventually, he admitted that the exchange of messages were between Rakib and the holder of the number XXX<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>. When asked who was the holder of the number XXX, the Accused was again extremely evasive before finally admitting that he was the registered owner of the number<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">I found the Accused untruthful in his account in relation to the exchange of WhatsApp messages. I therefore rejected his allegation that Rakib was moonlighting at “Ping Form”. From the exchange of messages, it was clear to me that Rakib was supplied to “Ping Form” by the Accused and I accepted Rakib’s explanation on this.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_viii"></a>(viii)    The Accused tried to give an explanation for being the registered owner of the number XXX by saying that the number was given to the office staff to use. However, this was the number that was given to IO Annabelle in his statement (P25), after investigations had started and is also his number in the court records. I therefore disbelieved his claim that the number was for “company use”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> – the Accused’s claim that the line was for “company use” was an attempt on his part to distant himself from Rakib’s claim that he was deployed by the Accused to work at “Ping Form” and had contacted the Accused regarding the payment of salary for his work at “Ping Form”.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_ix"></a>(ix)     With respect to declaration letters, I placed no weight on them. I accepted the evidence of the foreign employees that they were not given a chance to read the declaration letters, and were told to sign them together with a stack of other documents. In addition, I noted that there is no evidence that the letters were properly interpreted to them before they were signed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_x"></a>(x)     In relation to the fact that the IPAs had stated that no agency fee was collected, I placed no weight to it. As pointed out by the Prosecution and I agreed, I did not think the Accused would incriminate himself by stating that an agency fee was collected. He was careful not to leave behind any paper trail as can been seen from the fact that all the fees were paid in cash. In any event, the foreign employees testified that in reality, they knew that a fee had to be paid if they wanted to work in Singapore, and they accepted that.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I next considered the evidence of Yoraju. While Yoraju tried to give evidence to help the Accused, especially in relation to the preparation of the withdrawal letters and a letter signed by Chandra Moorthy proclaiming that the foreign employees had “given false information about agent fees/transfer fees” against the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> (D54) (“Chandra Moorthy’s letter”), I found that his credibility had been impeached by P27, which was a statement given by Yoraju on 20 June 2018, in the course of investigation. Yoraju did not challenge the voluntariness of the statement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In his statement (P27), Yoraju admitted that the withdrawal letters<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> and Chandra Moorthy’s letter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> were prepared based on the instructions of the Accused. In addition, Yoraju gave evidence during the trial that the Accused was not present when the foreign employees signed the withdrawal letters<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span>, which contradicted his statement that the Accused was present. When confronted with the obvious inconsistencies, Yoraju prevaricated and was unable to provide any credible explanation. In the circumstances, I rejected his evidence that the Accused was not instrumental in the preparation of the withdrawal letters and Chandra Moorthy’s letter. In all likelihood, the withdrawal letters and Chandra Moorthy’s letter were prepared based on the instructions of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I next considered the weight, if any, to be placed on the withdrawal letters and Chandra Moorthy’s letter. Yoraju claimed that these were explained and interpreted to the four foreign employees. However, this was not put to any of them and the Defence had breached the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em>r<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>. In any event, for the reasons stated above, I found Yoraju to be an unreliable witness. I therefore placed no weight on the withdrawal letters. Similarly, I placed no weight on Chandra Moorthy’s letter. First, I found that the letter was likely prepared based on the instructions of the Accused. Second, if the maker of the statement was Chandra Moorthy, he should have come to court to give evidence. But he did not do so and no explanation was given for his failure to testify in court. Finally, I accepted the foreign employees’ evidence that they did not give false information against the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     As regards Yoraju’s claim of the Accused’s poor command of English, my observation was that the Accused clearly understood English, as on a few occasions, he had responded to questions even before they were interpreted to him by the interpreter. Furthermore, the Accused had been living in Singapore for more than 20 years (and had been a PR since 2007). He had also run various business<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> while he was living here. Therefore, while the Accused may not be an expert in the English language, I was of the view that it was an exaggeration to say that he had a poor command of English.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The alleged inadequacies in the investigations</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In the course of the trial and in its closing submissions, the Defence alleged that IO Annabelle’s investigations were inadequate, for example, her failure to retrieve the CCTV footage and Raju’s bank statement. While these exhibits might strengthen the Prosecution’s case against the Accused, the lack of which was not detrimental to its case, as the Prosecution’s case was based primarily on the evidence of the foreign employees and their witnesses, all of whom I found to be credible witnesses. In any event, it was not the Prosecution’s burden to prove its case beyond all doubt (see <em>Teo Keng Pong v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0890.xml')">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 890</a> at [68]) – the burden is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As for the allegation that IO Annabelle was dishonest – I did not think that there was sufficient evidence to support that allegation. However, I noted that she could have been better prepared for trial.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accused was not prejudiced by the amendments to the charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Finally, I considered if the Accused was prejudiced in anyway by the amendments to four of the charges after parties had closed their case. The Accused’s defence was one of bare denial in relation to MAC-903274-2018, MAC-903273-2018 and MAC-908892-2018. I made amendments to the date of offence in MAC-903274-2018 and MAC-908892-2018, and adjusted the amount involved downwards in MAC-903273-2018 and MAC-908892-2018, based on the evidence of Hasanuzzaman (PW13), Kabir (PW14) and Rakibul (PW12) during the trial. As for MAC-903260-2018, it was amended to correct a spelling error of the foreign employee’s name.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Consequently, I was of the view that the amendments to these four charges did not prejudice the Accused in any way. In any event, the Prosecution and the Defence were asked if they would like to recall any witnesses pursuant to the amendments, and they declined.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the Accused accordingly of all charges except for MAC-903261-2018, MAC-908895-2018 and MAC-903258-2018. In relation to these three charges, I found that there was insufficient evidence, based on the evidence of the Prosecution, to convict the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Sentence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     An offence under section 22A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the EFMA is punishable with a fine not exceeding $30,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or with a fine and a term of imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Accused was traced for unrelated offences<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties’ position on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In the present case, the Prosecution indicated that they would have submitted for a fine of $14,000 per charge<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> against the Accused as “the sentencing norm for such offences” was a fine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span>. However, as the Accused was unable to pay the “hefty fine”, the Prosecution agreed with the Defence’s submission for a global sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> and a disgorgement order for the amount of $48,000 (in default, 120 days’ imprisonment)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> which was the total amount involved in the convicted charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The Defence submitted for a total sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment (with six sentences to run consecutively)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>, and for the disgorgement of $48,000 (in default, 50 days’ imprisonment)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span>. The breakdown of the sentence was set out in pages 5 and 6 of the mitigation plea.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mitigation plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In mitigation, the Defence submitted, <em>inter alia</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_i"></a>(i)     the Accused was cooperative with the authorities;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the Accused did not create a false paper trail nor was there a sophisticated scheme involved in the commission of the offences;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the Accused did not keep any of the fees he received from the workers, nor was he the mastermind; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     the Accused was unable to pay any fine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I agreed with the Defence and the Prosecution a custodial term in place of a fine was appropriate given that the Accused was unable to pay the fine, if imposed, given the hefty amount involved. The Prosecution would have submitted for a fine of $14,000 (in default, four weeks’ imprisonment) per charge in the present case. This would translate to a total fine of $294,000 for the 21 charges that the Accused was convicted on. If he was unable to pay the fine, he would then have to serve a default sentence of 84 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In the circumstances, an appropriate custodial term would better reflect the culpability of the Accused person rather than the Accused having to serve a default term of 84 weeks’ imprisonment which would have been too harsh.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I next considered the appropriate sentence for the individual charges by taking into account the amount involved in each charge, the aggravating factors (if any) and the mitigating factors raised by the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In the present case, the Accused had claimed trial. While it was the Accused’s right to claim trial to the charges, it would mean that the Accused was not entitled to any discount in the sentence, unlike in the case of an offender pleading guilty to his charge in a timeous manner. The evidence-taking for the trial took 27 days and a total of 24 witnesses were called, 20 of whom were foreign witnesses requiring a Bengali interpreter. Considerable resources were thus expended.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I did not find any exceptional factors in the mitigation plea. It is well established that, other than in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances, personal or financial hardships carries little mitigating value and “may not be relied on during mitigation” (<em>Ong Ker Seng v PP</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 406 at [30] and <em>PP v Tan Fook Sum</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022.xml')">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022</a> at [31]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    While I agreed that there was no complicated scheme involved in the offences, such offences were not easy to detect given that most foreign employees appeared to accept that they had to pay a fee in order to work in Singapore. In addition, some of the foreign employees in the present case were told to sign declaration letters<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> stating that they had not paid any agency fee in order to be employed by BS Global or BSA Construction. This showed an attempt on the Accused’s part to cover up his offences. Further, the withdrawal letters purportedly signed by four of the employees<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> were also an attempt on his part to thwart investigations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    However, I gave considerable weight to the fact that the Accused had no similar past antecedents and there was no evidence that he benefitted directly or personally from the full amount that he collected from the foreign employees.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The charges involved varying amounts which were given to the Accused by the foreign employees and ranged from $1,000 to $5,000. I took the view that, where the present case was concerned, the higher the amount involved, the higher the custodial term, and a term of imprisonment of between two and five weeks’ imprisonment for each of the charges would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The Prosecution submitted that the Angullia Mosque offences were more aggravating as the Accused did not fulfil his promise to the foreign employees for them to be transferred to his other company after taking money from them. However, I did not think that this should necessarily be taken as an aggravating factor as the case should be viewed in context – it was clear to me that at the relevant time, the Accused’s companies had some cash-flow issues and had some difficulties paying the workers their salary. Even if the workers were transferred, it was possible that they might not end up being in a better position as they would then have worked and not be paid. For example, the foreign employees testified that they were not paid their salary, and while the salary issue was eventually settled at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management, the foreign employees testified that they settled for a sum which was less than what was owed to them in terms of salary.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In the event, I imposed the following

clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In relation to the number of consecutive terms and the appropriate global sentence, I found guidance in the case of <em>Muhammad Sutarno bin Nasir v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22207-SSP.xml')">[2018] 2 SLR 647</a> at [22] to [24]. As the charges which the Accused was convicted on involved 15 foreign employees, I ordered eight of the sentences<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> involving different foreign employees to run consecutively as ordering 15 consecutive sentences would be excessive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I was mindful that the default sentence for the disgorgement amount of $48,000 would ordinarily be higher than the 40 days’ imprisonment which I had imposed. However, my view was that the default sentence was fair given that the Accused was genuinely unable to pay, and would already be serving a total sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment for the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Observations</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The Defence filed an appeal against both conviction and sentence, even though the total sentence imposed was a sentence which the Defence sought, and which it thought was “very fair”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span>. The default term was also lower than the default term of 50 days that the Defence submitted for. The Defence claimed that because there would be an appeal, it would “have to file both on conviction and the sentence”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> and that it was “[the Accused’s] position”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    It is surprising that the Defence thought that an appeal would have to be against both conviction <em>and</em> sentence, considering the fact that counsel is a senior member of the bar – an appeal can either be against conviction or sentence, or against both. If his client, the Accused, had thought that an appeal had to be against both conviction <em>and</em> sentence, it would be counsel’s duty to disabuse his client of that notion and advise his client accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Having given careful consideration to the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, and was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the charges, other than MAC-903258-2018, MAC-903261-2018 and MAC-908895-2018. In my view, a total sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment and a disgorgement order for the amount of $48,000 (in default 40 days’ imprisonment) would adequately reflect the culpability of the Accused and would give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Day 11, p 61.</p> <p
