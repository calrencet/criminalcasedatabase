(1st limb)”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Case for the Prosecution</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The victims named in the two charges, Gao FengFeng (“PW1”) and Lin Shengjian (“PW2”) both rented separate rooms at Block 201, Telok Kurau Road, #XXX (“the flat”). PW1 has been acquainted with PW2 for more than ten years as they hailed from the same village in China.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The accused is also known to PW1. PW1 identified the accused as a friend of PW2 and he, PW2 has met the accused a few times at the worksite where PW2 works. PW2 was a foreman at a construction site. He has never seen the accused at the unit.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The housebreaking charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 24 April 2019, PW1 woke up at about 0900 hrs and prepared to go to work. On the way to the bus-stop, he saw the accused. The accused told him that he was looking for PW2. PW1 assumed that PW2 had already left for work as he usually left for work earlier, between 0700 and 0800 hrs. He therefore told the accused that PW2 was not at home. PW1 then continued his way to the bus-stop. However, he soon realised that he had forgotten to bring along his key to the shop, and so he had to return to the flat.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       When he approached his block, he noticed the accused outside the lift at the level 1 lift lobby. When the lift door opened, the accused followed PW1 into the lift. He then told PW1 that he was looking for PW2 because PW2 owed him money. He had come to the block very early that morning. When the lift door opened again, the accused followed PW1 as PW1 walked towards the flat.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As PW1 opened the door to the flat, he told the accused not to come in as he was only going in to retrieve his shop keys. He then shut the gate without locking it. As PW1 was retrieving his keys, the accused opened the unlocked metal gate and entered the flat. Seeing the accused in the unit and standing near the door, PW1 told the accused to leave the flat as he was going back to work.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       PW1 tried to push the accused gently out the door but he refused to move and continued to walk into the living room. PW1 then tried to push the accused but the accused suddenly used both his hands to push on PW1’s shoulder. The accused PW1 aside before rushing into the living room.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Once in the living room, the accused picked up a metal saw that was on the table. The teeth of the metal saw was covered with a plastic cover. This saw belonged to PW2, who had brought it home from work. The accused removed the plastic cover and swung the saw at the PW1. PW1 raised his right hand to stop him, and in the process, the metal saw cut his hand, palm and elbow.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At this point of time, perhaps because of the ongoing scuffle, PW2 opened the door of his bedroom. Seeing PW2, the accused then ran towards him. Thereafter, PW1 could no longer say what happened because he ran to the toilet to wash his wound. He also the police. Having called the police and cleaned his wound, PW1 came out of the toilet when he didn’t hear anymore sounds coming from outside the toilet.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     When he emerged from the toilet, he saw PW2 speaking to the accused in the living room. He noticed that the saw was still in the accused’s hand, but it was now pointed towards the floor. As they were talking, PW2 took the saw and placed it back on the table. PW1 then waited in the living room for the police to arrive.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The criminal intimidation charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     PW2, the named victim in the second charge, has known the accused for between seven to eight years, when they were still in China. He had previously worked with the accused at the same worksite in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On the morning of 24 April 2019, he was sleeping in his room when he was awoken by sounds of quarrelling outside his bedroom. He opened the bedroom door saw both PW1 and the accused. When he opened the door, PW2 saw the accused holding a saw with his right hand. He also saw that PW1’s hand bleeding. Seeing PW2, the Accused ran towards him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having reached him, the accused then placed the saw with its teeth on PW2’s shoulder, over his clothes. PW2 felt scared. The accused then demanded immediate payment of money that PW2 owed him. According to PW2, the amount owed to the accused was about $12,000. PW2 requested for a few days to repay the amount as he was unable to do so immediately. PW2 explained to the court that he had borrowed the money from the accused to gamble.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Although he was scared, PW2 walked over to the sofa and sat down. The accused followed and stood in front of him, still holding the saw. Subsequently, when PW1 came out of the toilet, PW1 informed him that he had called the police. They then waited for the police to arrive. PW2 confirms that he was not injured as a result of the accused’s actions.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case for the defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The accused is presently unemployed. He is able to remain in Singapore because he is a dependant pass holder. He had come to Singapore in 2001. He and PW2 were both housemates about 15 years ago when they were living in a flat in Marsiling.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     PW2 had borrowed money from him on numerous occasions and had given him various reasons why he needed the money. For example, PW2 had claimed that he needed money to buy materials. The accused claimed that he had borrowed money from others in order to lend PW2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> As at 24 April 2019, PW2 owed him $23,000 and had been delaying repayment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     According to the accused, on 22 April 2019, PW2 had left a voice message, telling the accused that he could “come over” to collect the money from him on either 23 or 24 April 2019. He would pay the accused $500 first.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 24 April 2019, the accused woke up early and cycled to the flat. He arrived at the block at about 0500 hrs and waited at the staircase. He then fell asleep. At about 0900 hrs or so, he woke up and went up to the flat, but the door was locked. He therefore took the lift back down to the ground floor where he saw PW1 for the first time that day. Contrary to what PW1 had said in his evidence, the accused claims that he had not met PW1 earlier that morning when PW1 was on his way to work.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The accused then asked PW1 about PW2’s whereabouts but PW1 remained quiet. The accused decided to follow PW1 up the lift. He also asked PW1 to call the police, but again, PW1 remained quiet. He also tried showing PW1 an “I Owe You” (“IOU”) note from PW2 on his handphone but PW1 didn’t say anything again. When PW1 reached the flat and opened the door, the accused simply followed PW1 in.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.He claimed that PW1 “let” him go in although PW1 had not said anything. He mentioned that he had previously gone in and out of the flat when he was in the company of PW2.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     When the accused was in the flat, about three metres from the door, PW1 suddenly turned around and wanted to kill him. PW1 started strangling him and pushed him into a corner. The accused could hardly breathe, and his hand was trying to reach out for anything nearby to defend himself. He managed to grab hold on to a saw. When PW1 saw him with the saw, PW1 ran towards the toilet. The accused did not follow PW1.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The accused then proceeded to PW2’s room and knocked on the door. He then retreated to where a round table was as he was afraid that PW2 would dash out of the room. He then removed the teeth guard of the saw. He intended to use the saw to protect himself against PW1 and PW2.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     When PW2 woke up, he opened the door and came out of the bedroom. When PW2 saw PW1in the living room, he asked PW1 to call the police. After this, the accused simply stood next to the round table and placed the saw on it. The accused noticed that PW1’s thumb was bleeding but he was unaware how PW1 suffered this injury. He denies using the metal saw to threaten PW2.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis of the Evidence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The housebreaking charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Having considered the evidence of the accused and PW1, I found that the evidence of PW1 was more believable. It was clear and unequivocal. When PW1 entered the flat, he did not lock the metal gate to keep the accused out but simply closed it behind him. However, he told the accused not to come in. He had a good and simple reason. PW just wanted to go into the flat to get the shop keys and then leave for work immediately. He did not want to be delayed. The actions of PW1 were logical and externally consistent.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the other hand, I did not find the accused’s version of events believable. The accused gave evidence that he had been “invited” to the flat by PW2 to collect the money that was owed. However, his own evidence and actions that morning suggested otherwise. It does not appear that he had been expressly invited by PW2. In cross-examination, the accused conceded that PW2 had never told him what time to meet. If the accused had bene told what time to meet, there would have been no necessity for the accused to arrive at the flat at 0500 hrs. The reason why the Accused was at the block there so early that morning was to catch PW2 when he left the flat for work as he obviously did not believe PW2 when he said he would return him the money as PW2 had not kept his promise to repay him on numerous previous occasions. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Next, the accused “presumed” that he had permission to enter the flat. That was why he was surprised when PW1 began strangling when after he entered the flat. I did not find this explanation compelling. The accused had himself conceded that he had no expressed permission to enter the unit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. His own evidence was that PW1 had been quiet throughout the time they had walked together from the lift to the flat. The fact is that he did not have any permission, expressed or implied to enter the flat.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Even if I took his evidence at its highest and accepted that he had some form of permission to enter the flat, would seem strange that PW1 would allow him entry into the flat only to then begin strangling him once he had entered it. There does not seem to be any logic to this. Indeed, even if as alleged by the accused, that PW1 and PW2 were in cahoots, and PW1 did not want the accused to know that PW2 was in the flat, surely it would have made more sense for PW1 to refuse the accused entry into the flat by locking or securing the metal gate instead of simply closing it or, not close it at all, in the Accused’s own version. This would be a natural and logical reaction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Next, even if I accepted the accused’s evidence that PW1 started strangling him after he entered the unit, then the logical reason why PW1 would have done this must be that he was trying to remove the accused from the flat because the accused had it without his permission. Either way one looks at it, the accused’s version of events does not appear believable or viable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In fact, the accused’s version of events also does not tally with the statement he had given the police on the day of the incident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. In the statement, he conceded that he had followed PW1 into the flat but was stopped from entering the flat when PW1 noticed him entering the flat. PW1 then tried to prevent him from entering the flat by pushing his shoulder using his hands. The accused resisted and continued to enter this unit. They ended up at the living room. It is remarkable how the accused’s own statement is broadly similar to the account that PW1 had given to court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In my view, what happened that morning was that PW1, having seen the accused approach him, was ignoring him on purpose. When PW1 entered the flat to retrieve his shop keys, he closed the metal gate behind him, telling the accused not to come in. He did not want the accused in the flat as he was going to work. Instead, the accused opened the metal gate and entered the flat. Upon noticing this, PW1 attempted to push the accused out of the flat but he was unsuccessful. Instead, the accused pushed PW1 aside to get further into the unit. This resulted in a scuffle between the accused and PW1.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution had proven the housebreaking charge against the accused and that he had not raised any doubt at all in my mind. I therefore found the him guilty and convicted of the charge under s 453 of the PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The criminal intimidation charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The accused’s version of events is, unsurprisingly different from that given by PW2. According to him, at no time did he intimidate PW2 by placing the metal saw on his shoulder. The accused, however, admitted that he had picked up the saw from the table during the scuffle with PW1. He did so as a form of self defence against PW1 and PW2. Once again, after examining the evidence of the accused, I did not find his version of events logical nor persuasive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The accused maintained his position that he had taken the metal saw in “self-defence”. This is again not evident from the evidence. He has told the court that he picked up the saw during his scuffle with PW1 who ran towards the toilet upon seeing this. He then knocked on PW2’s bedroom door and then retreated because he was worried that PW2 would dash out. This was when he removed the saw’s teeth guard<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. I am not sure why the accused thought that self-defence was necessary at this point. PW1 had already ran away to another part of the flat and posed no immediate threat to him, whilst PW2 had not even yet come out of the bedroom. It did not make sense that, on one hand, the accused wanted PW2 to come out of his room but at the same time suggesting that he had to defend himself against PW2. In addition, if the Accused version of events is to be believed and PW2 had truly invited the accused to the flat to collect $500, it would be curious why PW2 would have dash out of his room to attack him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In my view, PW2’s version of what happened is more consistent and logical. He had heard people quarrelling outside his bedroom. When he came out of the bedroom, he saw the accused standing there holding a saw without its cover. The accused then rushed forward to confront him about the money owed. This was when the accused placed the saw on PW2’s shoulder and demanded repayment of the debt. PW2’s description of the accused’s actions when he opened the bedroom door is exactly what one would expect from a person who has been owed money by another who had not only yet to repay it but also given numerous excuses in the past to avoid repayment of the debt. It is unsurprising that the accused was upset as he was since he had borrowed money from others to lend PW2. The accused actions in the flat did not match that of a person who had been invited over to collect part of a debt, namely $500.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Although PW2’s actions in not repaying the debt owed left much to be desired, I was of the view that PW2 did not embellish his evidence. I found his evidence candid and forthright. He volunteered the fact that he had used the borrowed money to gamble. He need not have done so. He had also simply admitted as a matter of fact that he felt scared when the metal saw was placed on his shoulder but at the same time, he readily conceded that he was not injured, and neither were his clothes damaged. He could have exaggerated how he felt but he did not. Also, his evidence of what happened it the flat matcheed that given by PW1.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     All considered, although I cannot condone PW2’s actions in not repaying the money owed, I am nonetheless of the view that his evidence is more believable. I found that the Prosecution had proven its case of criminal intimidation beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the accused guilty and convicted him on the criminal intimidation charge under s 506 of the PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents, submissions on sentence and plea in mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The accused has no antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For the housebreaking charge, the Prosecution highlighted that “<em>even for innocuous cases of housebreaking, a sentence of at least four weeks’ imprisonment would be imposed</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     However, the Prosecution sought an uplift of four weeks’ imprisonment for a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment. This was warranted as the accused was found guilty after a trial; that the offence was premeditated, and the accused intended to enter the flat by following PW1 knowing that he was not an invited guest; that the type of property broken into was residential property; that the offence was committed by the use of criminal force against an occupant; and that he had committed criminal intimidation subsequently in the property.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For the criminal intimidation charge, the Prosecution submitted that the usual sentencing range was between eight to 12 weeks’ imprisonment. However, as there was no verbal threat uttered and neither was the offence premeditated, the Prosecution had therefore calibrated their sentencing submission to six weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Prosecution submitted that the sentences of imprisonment imposed for the two charges should be consecutive, making a total global sentence of 14 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In mitigation, the Accused informed the court that he had nothing to say. He just wanted the court to be fair.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Considerations</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The housebreaking charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The punishment prescribed by law under s 453 of the PC is a term of imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     First, I agreed that the usual tariff for a s 453 PC charge was in the region of four weeks’ imprisonment. In addition to the cases that have been cited by the Prosecution, I had also reviewed several other cases that have been dealt with by the district courts. For example:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="27.56%"/> <col width="51.04%"/> <col width="21.4%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Case</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Brief Facts</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sentence (for s.453)</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>PP v.

In determining the appropriate sentence, I considered how the accused had gained access into flat. Compared to the cases above, I was unable to say that his culpability was as high as in the two cases I have highlighted above. In addition, contrary to the submissions of the Prosecution, I did not find that this was a premeditated offence. The accused had seen PW1 enter the flat without locking the metal gate it behind him and took the opportunity to enter it and thereafter pushed PW1 aside. He did not use any implements or tools to gain entry.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I also took note why he entered the premises. It was not to steal. His entry into the flat was simply an attempt to recover the monies owed to him by PW2. It was probably fuelled by anger and frustration by PW2’s numerous delays in repaying the debt. There was nothing mischievous about his actions. Furthermore, I was also of the view that the fact that he had pushed PW1 aside to again entry did warrant an uplift in the sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I was therefore adjudged that a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate in the circumstances and sentenced him accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The criminal intimidation charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The punishment prescribed by law for the first limb of criminal intimidation under s 506 of the PC is a term of imprisonment of up to two years, or with a fine, or with both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For the offence of criminal intimidation, the sentence that is imposed would depend on a variety of factors. These would include, for example, the nature of any threat made and whether this was done with or without a weapon. In the instant case, the accused had used a metal saw to commit the offence. However, the use of the metal saw in the commission of the offence was not premeditated. The metal saw was a weapon of opportunity, one that he had grabbed in a scuffle with PW1.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     First, I noted that despite using a metal saw, no injury was caused to PW2. Also, other than placing the metal saw on PW2’s shoulder and demanding the return of monies owed, the accused made no threats of any nature against PW2. I further noted that this act of criminal intimidation did not last for any prolonged period and the situation cooled down considerably very rapidly despite his anger with PW2. In fact, by the time PW1 came back to the living room, the metal saw was already pointed to the floor, indicating that there was no longer any danger</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Considering the mitigating factors that were present, I was of the view that a modest sentencing discount from the submitted sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate. As such, I sentenced the accused to five weeks’ imprisonment. I empathised why the accused felt so angry <em>via-a-vis</em> PW2 and why he did what he did. Nonetheless what the accused did was wrong.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentence imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In summary, I imposed the following sentences on the accused:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="52.1%"/> <col width="47.9%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Charge Number</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sentence Imposed</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The housebreaking charge</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(DAC-920643-2019)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The criminal intimidation charge </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(DAC-920645-2019)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">5 weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consecutive or concurrent sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As the Accused was convicted of two charges, the court had a discretion as to whether to run the two sentences of imprisonment consecutively or concurrently. I agreed with the Prosecution that the two sentences of imprisonment should run consecutively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Although they were committed in close proximity to each other in terms of time, both offences were nonetheless distinct. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the offences had no continuity of action, nor in purpose and design. The victims in both charges were also different. In addition, if the sentences were to run consecutively, the total sentence that would be imposed on the accused, namely nine weeks’ imprisonment would not be a crushing sentence and would be in line with the totality principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Accordingly, I ordered the two sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. Therefore, the total sentence imposed was nine weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The accused, being dissatisfied with the conviction and the sentence I have imposed, now appeals against both the conviction and sentence. The accused is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript.
