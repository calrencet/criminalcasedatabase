class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The first accused was a principal at a tuition centre. The second and third accused and also an accomplice were teachers at the said tuition centre. The first and second accused are also related. They hatched a scheme to abet six of their students to cheat in five papers of the 2016 GCE ‘O’ Level Examinations. They did so by remotely communicating with and providing them with answers during the examinations using mobile phones and wireless receivers and earpieces that were concealed under the students’ clothes. The second accused and the accomplice even registered as private candidates and took turns to sit for examinations in order to provide a live video stream of the examination questions to the other accused persons stationed at the tuition centre. They would then communicate the answers to the students over the earpiece worn by the students. Eventually, one of the students was caught cheating by the invigilators and the cheating scheme was uncovered and stopped.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The accused persons were charged respectively with 27 charges of abetment to cheat. They were individually represented by counsel and they claimed trial to all the charges. At the close of the prosecution’s case, they were called to give their defence to the charges but they all elected to remain silent. They also did not call any other defence witnesses. At the conclusion of the trial, the three accused were convicted of all the charges and sentenced to 48 months’ imprisonment, 36 months’ imprisonment and 28 months’ imprisonment respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first and second accused appealed against their conviction and sentence which has been stayed pending the appeal. The third accused initially did not file any appeal and started serving his sentence. Subsequently, he was granted leave by the High Court, pursuant to a criminal motion, to file an appeal out of time only against his sentence. He has done so and continues to serve his imprisonment sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The three accused persons claimed trial to 27 charges, comprising 26 counts of abetment by way of conspiracy to cheat which is punishable under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Revised Edition) (“the Penal Code”) and one count of attempted conspiracy to cheat under s 417 read with s 116 of the Penal Code. The details of the 27 proceeded charges are summarised in Annex A of these grounds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Save for the details relating to the date and subject of the examination and the name of the student taking the examination, the charges against the accused persons are similarly framed. In view of the large number of charges, I will set out, by way of an example for reference, one charge against the first accused where the act abetted was committed in consequence of the cheating:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>MAC- 911250-2016</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You…are charged that you, on or around 20 October 2016, in Singapore, did abet an offence of cheating, by engaging with Chen Yi, Feng Riwen, Poh Min Fiona, Tan Jia Yan, and others unknown (“the conspirators”), in a conspiracy to cheat the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (“SEAB”), by deceiving SEAB into believing that Chen Yi was taking the GCE ‘O’ Level Mathematics Paper 1 (“the examination”) without assistance from any other person, to wit, by dishonestly concealing the fact that Chen Yi would be receiving assistance from the aforementioned conspirators, in order to intentionally induce SEAB to accept Chen Yi’s answer script as a legitimate submission for marking, an act SEAB would not do were it not so deceived, which act was likely to cause harm to SEAB’s reputation, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that cheating, an act took place, to wit¸ Chen Yi sat for the GCE ‘O’ Level Mathematics Paper 1 on 20 October 2016 at 2:30 p.m. at 252 Tampines Street 12, Tampines Secondary School, Singapore, while receiving assistance from the aforementioned conspirators, which offence of cheating was committed in consequence of the abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 417 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I also set out, for reference, the single charge against the first accused (which is similarly framed as the corresponding charge against the second and third accused) where the act abetted was <em>not</em> committed as a consequence of the abetment. This relates to the final incident where the student in question was caught trying to cheat and the entire scheme came to an abrupt end. The said charge reads as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>MAC- 911249-2016</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You…are charged that you, on or around 24 October 2016, in Singapore, did abet an offence of cheating, by engaging with Chen Yi, Feng Riwen, Poh Min Fiona, Tan Jia Yan, and others unknown (“the conspirators”), in a conspiracy to cheat the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (“SEAB”), by deceiving SEAB into believing that Chen Yi was taking the GCE ‘O’ Level English Paper 1 (“the examination”) without assistance from any other person, to wit, by dishonestly concealing the fact that Chen Yi would be receiving assistance from the aforementioned conspirators, in order to intentionally induce SEAB to accept Chen Yi’s answer script as a legitimate submission for marking, an act SEAB would not do were it not so deceived, which act was likely to cause harm to SEAB’s reputation, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that cheating, an act took place, to wit¸ Chen Yi sat for the GCE ‘O’ Level English Paper 1 on 24 October 2016 at 1:30 p.m. at 252 Tampines Street 12, Tampines Secondary School, Singapore, while receiving assistance from the aforementioned conspirators, which offence of cheating was not committed in consequence of the abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 417 read with section 116 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       For completeness, the first and second accused also faced additional charges, including a joint charge under s 204A of the Penal Code, for perverting the course of justice by allegedly instigating one of the students to leave Singapore to avoid investigations. These charges have been stood down pending the trial.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The prosecution’s case and the evidence adduced in support of its case are set out in the prosecution’s opening statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and its closing submission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. I will summarise the prosecution’s case and its evidence in the following paragraphs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The prosecution’s evidence presented a case of serial cheating during the 2016 GCE ‘O’ Level Examinations (“the Examination”), a national examination, and in an organized manner by the accused persons and their accomplice.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The evidence showed that on 26 October 2016, the Police acted on a report filed by the Singapore Examinations Assessment Board (“SEAB”) after one of its invigilators caught a candidate (“Chen Yi”) cheating when sitting for a paper during the Examination. Chen Yi cheated by way of assistance being provided to him remotely through an ‘in-ear’ earpiece which was connected wirelessly to a mobile phone and Bluetooth transmitter (collectively referred as the “communication devices”) which were taped to his body and concealed under his clothes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Investigations quickly uncovered a syndicate comprising the accused persons and their accomplice who were working at (and possibly other individuals connected with) Zeus Education Centre (“Zeus”), a private tuition centre. The syndicate had engaged in a conspiracy to abet the students of Zeus to cheat in the Examination. The first accused was the principal of Zeus and the other two accused and their accomplice were teachers employed by the first accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The identities of the three accused persons are:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     First accused, Poh Yuan Nie @ Pony Poh (“Pony”);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second accused Fiona Poh (“Fiona”); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Feng Riwen (“Riwen”)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Pony and Fiona were related in that Fiona referred to Pony as her “uncle”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There was an accomplice, Tan Jia Yan (“Jia Yan”), who was also a teacher at Zeus. Unlike the three accused, Jia Yan decided to plead guilty at the start of the present trial to her set of corresponding charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The three accused persons each faced 27 charges. Together with Jia Yan, the evidence showed that they abetted six of their students to cheat in five examination papers which took place over 6 days i.e. 19 October 2016 to 24 October 2016. The five examination papers are set out chronologically as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>a)     Science Practical Paper on 19 October 2016;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>b)     Mathematics Paper 1 on 20 October 2016;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>c)     Mathematics Paper 2 on 21 October 2016;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>d)     English Paper 1 on 24 October 2016; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>e)     English Paper 2 also on 24 October 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused persons’ modus operandi</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Five of the six students in question whom the accused persons abetted to cheat, testified as prosecution witnesses. They testified that the three accused persons and Jia Yan abetted them to cheat during the Examination using a sophisticated modus operandi (“MO”). The conditioned statement of the sixth student was admitted in evidence by consent of counsels.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In summary, the MO involved Fiona and Jia Yan registering as private candidates and taking turns (mostly Jia Yan) to sit for the same examination papers at the same time as the students. Whoever was sitting for the paper would then video-call the other person (who would be standing by at Zeus) using the “FaceTime” application. The video-call enabled a live stream of the examination questions to the teachers at Zeus who would then provide the answers to the students via the communication devices.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The students were instructed by the accused persons to first report to Zeus before proceeding to the examination venue for each examination paper. When the students reported at Zeus, the accused persons would affix (using sticky tape) the Bluetooth receivers on the students’ bodies which would be concealed beneath their clothes. The students were also provided with one or more mobile phones which were similarly concealed under their clothes. Finally, they wore a ear-piece which was skin-coloured and therefore not easily noticeable. The students would surrender their personal mobile phone before entering the examination hall but not the additional concealed mobile phones.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     During the examination, the students would receive a call which they would discretely answer by activating the Bluetooth device. Whoever was stationed at Zeus would then provide them with the answers over the ear-piece. The students would then write down the answers provided and hand in the examination scripts to the invigilators at the end of each paper. These examination scripts were sent by SEAB to Cambridge, United Kingdom, the very next day to be marked.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of the students</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The six students from Zeus who were abetted to cheat in the examination were all PRC nationals as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chen Yi (PW5), male 20-year-old;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chen Xiang (PW1), male 19-year-old;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     Zhou Zice (PW2), male 17-year-old;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     Xiao Junze, male 19-year-old;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     Zhang Jinlu (PW3), male 20-year-old; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_f"></a>(f)     Wang Fangfei (PW4), female 19-year-old.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The prosecution led oral evidence from five of the above students. The sixth student, Xiao Junze, had returned to China. His statement was admitted in evidence pursuant to s 32(1)(j) of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97) with the consent of parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Chen Xiang</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The first student to give evidence was PW1 Chen Xiang, a 19 year-old Chinese national. He came to Singapore in May 2016 with the intention to sit for the Examination. An agent in China made the arrangements for him to come to Singapore to take said Examination. He had to pay the agent a sum of money for the arrangement but cannot remember the amount paid. He was recommended a tuition centre i.e. Zeus. He stayed in a rented premise in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     He attended tuition lessons at Zeus for about two months prior to the Examination. His tuition teachers at Zeus were Fiona, Riwen and Jia Yan (“the teachers”). He did not think that the lessons were helpful.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     He testified that he cheated during the Examination and that the four teachers in Zeus had helped him and the other students to cheat. He identified the accused persons and Jia Yan to be the said four teachers. He also identified Pony to be the principal of Zeus. His Examination entry proof was admitted in evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The principal, Pony, first broached the issue of cheating on 18 October 2016 which was the day before Science examination paper. Pony instructed him to report to Zeus early the following morning so that the teachers could “help” him. As instructed, Chen Xiang went to Zeus the following morning. All the accused persons and Jia Yan were there. There were other students present, including Chen Yi and Wang Fangfei. He did not personally know all the students. Pony handed him a Bluetooth receiver to be used for cheating. He was taught how to use the device and they tested the device to ensure that it was working. Chen Xiang identified the communication devices in court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He added that the receiver was secured to his body and the earpiece was worn in one ear. His mobile phone would be connected or ‘paired’ to the Bluetooth receiver worn on his body. The teachers assisted him and the other students to secure the Bluetooth receivers to their bodies with tape stretching from the abdomen to the shoulder. The earpiece was skin-coloured.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The students were instructed that when they received a call, they were to press the button on the Bluetooth receiver to answer the call and someone would then read out the answers to them over the earpiece. Except for Pony, the other three teachers helped them to test the communication devices at Zeus. He had to step out of Zeus to test that the devices worked.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Chen Xiang and the students then proceeded to their respective examination venues for the Science practical paper. He went there by taxi. He registered his attendance and entered the examination hall to do the experiments. The accused persons called him about 20-30 minutes into the paper. He testified that he received the answers for part of the examination paper. He was afraid but fortunately, he was not caught.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     After the examination ended, he went back to Zeus where the teachers collected the communication devices back from him and the other students. They asked if he could hear the answers clearly. The process was repeated for the subsequent Mathematics (papers I and II) and English examination papers (papers I and II) i.e. reporting to Zeus to wear and test the communication devices, receiving assistance through calls during the examination, and returning the communication devices back to the teachers after the examination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     After the last paper, Fiona called him to inform that Chen Yi had been caught. He returned to Zeus and saw the accused persons discussing with Chen Yi. They wanted to send him back to China. Pony gave Chen Yi some money and Fiona booked his air-ticket online. Chen Yi’s mobile phone was seized by the invigilators and therefore Fiona helped to remotely erase the contents of Chen Yi’s mobile phone. Chen Xiang accompanied Chen Yi home and helped him to pack his luggage. He then accompanied Chen Yi to the airport for his flight back to China. As instructed, he reported to Fiona that Chen Yi had boarded the plane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     He sat for the subsequent examination papers without wearing the communication devices. He had no further contact with the accused persons thereafter. He tried to fly back to China in November but was stopped and referred to the police.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other students</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The oral testimonies of the other four students were consistent with Chen Xiang’s evidence. In summary, they similarly met the accused persons at Zeus on the days of the examination papers before proceeding to the examination venue. At Zeus, the accused persons (except Pony) and Jia Yan would assist them to wear and conceal the communication devices on their bodies and also to test the connections. They then proceeded to the examination venue to take the examination. During the examination, they would receive assistance from the accused persons or Jia Yan through the communication devices. The students also testified that they were briefed about the MO before the first examination paper of 19 October 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     One of the students, Zhang Jinlu, decided not to take and cheat in any further papers because he did not think it was right to do so. The remaining students, however, continued to sit for and cheat in the subsequent papers until Chen Yi was caught.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The conditioned statement of the sixth student, Xiao Junze, was admitted in evidence with the consent of parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> His statement was broadly consistent with the oral testimonies of the other students. He stated that his father had arranged with an agent, Dongxin, for him to have lessons in Zeus and to sit for the Examination. He came to Singapore three times in 2016 to sit for the various papers i.e. in May for the Chinese language papers, in July for the English oral examination and finally in October for the remaining papers. One of the teachers (Jia Yan) informed him that he would be provided assistance during the examination. He reported to Zeus in the morning of 19 October 2016 just before he took the first of the remaining papers i.e. the Science Practical Paper. At Zeus, the teachers attached two Bluetooth transmitters to his body and an earpiece in his ear. He then went for his examination. During the examination, he received answers from the teachers over the earpiece and he wrote down the answers. After the paper, he went back to Zeus to return the communication devices. This process was repeated for the subsequent Mathematics and English language papers. However, when the Additional Mathematics paper was held, he was not given the communication devices. Thereafter, he was unable to contact the teachers as his number was blocked. He was detained at the airport on 30 October 2016 just before his flight back to China.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     For completeness, Chen Yi testified as to the events after he was caught cheating on 24 October 2016. These events were also relevant to the stood down charge against Pony and Fiona for perverting the course of justice by instigating him to leave Singapore to avoid investigations.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of the accomplice</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The accomplice, Jia Yan, who is also named in the 27 charges against the three accused persons, testified as a prosecution witness and implicated the accused persons as conspirators in the cheating offences. In summary, Jia Yan gave the details of the conspiracy to cheat as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     The cheating at ‘O’ Level Examinations started several years before 2016 but was restricted to the English subject papers because the Chinese students had the most difficulties with the English language. She would register as a private candidate to sit for the English papers. She would read out the shortest English composition title to Pony who would then prepare the composition and feed it to the students. In 2015, Fiona became involved and helped Jia Yan to strap the latter’s mobile phone to her chest. During the examination, Jia Yan would live stream the questions to Pony and Fiona who remained at Zeus. They would then feed the answers to the students remotely.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     In 2016, Jia Yan was instructed by Pony to register the six students and herself as private candidates for the examination. The contact details that she provided of the students in fact belonged to the accused persons and her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Fiona also registered herself separately as a private candidate.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     After registering the students, she procured the Bluetooth devices and earpieces from China and paid for the purchases with Pony’s money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The 2016 operation was on a larger scale, requiring the purchase of more equipment, as it involved more students than before.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a>(d)     The students were instructed by Pony to report to Zeus before each examination paper.

The students turned up early at Zeus. The accused persons and she taped the Bluetooth devices to on the students’ bodies. These were connected to their mobile phones. The accused persons tested that the communication devices were working. The accused persons would call the students during the examination and provide them with answers.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_f"></a>(f)     Jia Yan further instructed the students to cough if they had difficulty receiving the answers. The students then proceeded to their respective examination venues.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_g"></a>(g)     Fiona helped Jia Yan secure the latter’s mobile phone to her chest with tape and the Bluetooth device to her shoulder. Jia Yan also wore an earpiece. She wore a jacket to conceal the communication devices on her body. During the examination, Fiona made a video call to Jia Yan who then provided a live stream of the examination questions back to Zeus. Fiona and the others would then then work out and call the students to provide the answers to them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This process was repeated for successive Mathematics and English papers.</p> <p></p> <div class="Judg-List-1-No"> (h) </div> <div class="Judg-List-1-Item"> Fiona and Jia Yan switched roles for Mathematics Paper 2 on 21 October 2016 because Jia Yan was stronger in Mathematics and remained at Zeus to work out the answers to the Maths questions. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> At the end of each paper, the students returned to Zeus to hand over the communication devices and also to report on any technical issues. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_i"></a>(i)     Chen Yi was caught cheating during the English examination on 24 October 2016. Pony requested Chen Yi to return to China. Jia Yan bought the air ticket for Chen Yi who left for China that night.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The following day, Pony met Dong Xin and refunded him the money paid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence from the invigilators and SEAB</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The cheating offences went undetected for the papers from 19 to 21 October 2016. However, one of the students, Chen Yi, was caught by an alert invigilator, Stephens Gloria (PW6)(“the invigilator”), on 24 October 2016 who heard unusual electronic transmission sounds emanating from the student. The invigilator decided to observe the said student and caught him using the communication devices to cheat.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The prosecution also led evidence from the SEAB as to the events after the discovery the cheating offences. The SEAB witness testified as to SEAB’s practice in administering examinations and underscored the importance of safeguarding the integrity of the examination system and to maintain public trust and confidence in SEAB’s administration of examinations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The invigilator identified Chen Yi in court. He was invigilating that day when Chen Yi sat for English Paper 1.

Additionally, in respect of the cautioned statements for the 9<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, 19<sup>th</sup>, 24<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> charge, she also stated that she did not know if the named student in fact cheated for the paper.

I now summarise the allegations, evidence adduced, my findings and the reasons for my findings in respect of each of the three ancillary hearings.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1)   1<sup>st</sup> Ancillary Hearing</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The first long statement under s 22 of the CPC was recorded from Fiona by Investigating Officer Eddie Ho (“IO Eddie”) on 27 October 2016 at 11.45 p.m.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Although no allegations were levelled at IO Eddie, Fiona alleged that the statement was involuntary as a result of the cumulative threats and inducements made to her from the time she was arrested (i.e. the day before) up till the time the statement was recorded on 27 October 2016. Her allegations are set out in the prosecution’s submission as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>a.     That she was informed by her brother that the police would not release her mother from ‘custody’ until the accused reported to the police station. She further claimed that while she was in remand (for up to 30 hours), she was not told of her mother’s whereabouts and that she was worried for her mother;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>b.     That during the night of 26 October 2016, IO Stanley Chew Hui Guan (“IO Stanley”) came into the room at Bedok Police Station where she was held in custody, slammed the table and screamed at her presumably wanting her to confess;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>c.     That on 27 October 2017, when she was escorted to Zeus for further investigations (“the raid”), the following intimidating remarks were made to her directly or indirectly:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_52-p2_c-p3_i"></a>i.       that all their pets would perish if no one cared for them; and</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_52-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>ii.       that Pony would die a lonely death or meet with an accident if Fiona did not confess.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_d"></a>d.     That the IOs threatened to summon her step-grandmother for questioning because the latter lied to cover up the whereabouts of Pony;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_e"></a>e.     That during the raid at Zeus, the officers advised her to confess because of all the seized evidence. They also promised her that her sentence would be reduced by half if she co-operated; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_f"></a>f.     That after the raid whilst still at Zeus, she became fearful when she overheard the IOs mention about a possible press release about the case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I will elaborate on some of the more material allegations outlined above. It is not in dispute that Fiona was arrested by the police on 26 October 2016 when she presented herself at Bedok Police Station. She claimed that IO Stanley, who was the main IO of the case, entered the room and shouted at her to confess or else he would “<em>give me seven years.</em>” She did not confess and so he left the room. However, she could hear him slamming the door and banging on the table. It sounded like he was enraged and she was afraid of him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     She was questioned by many other IOs. She claimed that Station Inspector Lim Teck Cheng (“IO Tony”) insisted that she was lying but did not make any real threats. She was then escorted back to Zeus by three officers for the raid. The three officers were IO Tan Yi Hao, IO Justin Ng and IO Ho Mun Geck (“IO Mun Geck”). She complained that they made her wait outside Zeus whilst they smoked a cigarette and that she was embarrassed because members of the public could see that she was under arrest. She claimed that during the raid, they made her fear that her pets would die if she remained in custody. They also made her worry about the well-being of her mother and grandmother. They further made her fearful that her ‘uncle’, Pony, who had a weak heart, would also die if she did not co-operate. She also claimed that the officers were discussing amongst themselves about a possible press release of the case. Finally, just before she was brought back to the station, IO Mun Geck threatened that she would be imprisoned for seven years but that if she co-operated, the sentence would be halved. IO Mun Geck also advised her to provide a statement to the recorder.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     At the conclusion of the first ancillary hearing, I considered and weighed all the testimonies including that of Fiona. My conclusion was that I believed the collective testimonies of the IOs and I found that the threats, inducements and promises alleged by Fiona did not, in fact, take place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     First and foremost, the accused could not identify any specific alleged act (be it a threat, inducement or promise) which had caused her to provide her statement involuntarily. Instead, she chose to lump the collective alleged conduct of all the IOs over a period of more than a day prior to her making her statement. I found that even if the acts and words were said and done by the IOs as alleged, it was obvious from her own testimony that she was neither intimidated nor induced, by any act done or word(s) said either individually or collectively, into providing her statement involuntarily.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I considered first her allegations against IO Stanley. I agree with the prosecution (as did counsel in his oral submission) that even if IO Stanley did raise his voice or appeared intimidating, that was insufficient to constitute a threat. Just because a police officer appeared fierce and threatening to an accused, that appearance in and of itself would not render a statement involuntary: <em>Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 0498.xml')">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 498</a>. It was further alleged that IO Stanley had threatened to “<em>give her seven years</em>” but she conceded during cross-examination that as a matter of logic, she did not believe him. Therefore, by her own admission, she was not affected by IO Stanley’s alleged behaviour and threats. As a matter of fact, she was not cowed into making a confession to IO Stanley. By her own testimony, she said she did not confess and therefore IO Stanley left the room in a huff. I also noted that she made the same allegation of a threat of “seven years” against IO Mun Geck. Considering that the offence of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment of no more than three years, it is inconceivable why either IO would threaten the accused with seven years’ imprisonment and it is even less likely that both IOs would make the same peculiar threat, independently of one another. I also considered that if at all, Fiona seemed only to be afraid of IO Stanley and not the other IOs. This is shown by her own claim that she complained to the other IOs about IO Stanley’s behaviour. In other words, she would appear to trust the other IOs enough to make the complaint to them about their fellow IO.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Although the accused claimed she was afraid that IO Stanley would hit her, she also acknowledged that she was aware that police officers are not allowed to hit anyone. She in fact acknowledged that she did not tell him what he wanted to hear and so he left the room. This would only mean that whatever IO Stanley had allegedly said to her in the room did not have the effect of intimidating her into making a confession. She also said she was not sure if IO Stanley was putting on an act when he started banging on the table and slamming the door after he left the room. In effect, the accused had conceded that she was not entirely certain that IO Stanley would in fact use violence against her. In short, I found her testimony that she was fearful was nothing more than a convenient lie. Even if she was afraid, her fears were unfounded and self-induced.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As regards her allegations of what happened at the tuition centre during the raid, I found them to be untrue and unfounded. First of all, she complained that she was made to wait outside Zeus in full view of the public. Even if that had caused her some degree of embarrassment, it would not amount to a form of threat or oppression. The same may be said of the alleged discussion about a press release of the case. As regards the alleged threats regarding her pets and her family members including Pony, I found that the alleged words or actions, even if these were said or done by the officers, had either been taken out of context or else misconstrued or even blown out of proportion. I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Fiona’s fears, if any, were self-induced, fanciful, illogical and were also disconnected from the alleged threats. I further found that even if she was worried about the well-being of her family members (including her pets for that matter), her fears would have been natural and consistent with anyone in that position of being in custody and investigated for serious offences. These fears, in and of themselves, did not render her statement involuntary.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     A key consideration which effectively and legally destroyed the veracity of her allegations is that she failed to state any of these allegations in her Case for Defence (“CFD”) that was filed in the course of the Criminal Case Disclosure Conferences at the pre-trial stage. This non-disclosure was confirmed and conceded by her counsel. The non-disclosure of these allegations contravened s 217(1)(d) of the CPC which provides that if the defence is objecting to any issue of fact in relation to any matter contained in the Case for the Prosecution, the CFD must contain a statement of the nature of the objection and the issue of fact on which evidence will be produced. This is clearly ventilated in illustration 2 as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="center"> <em>Illustration 2</em> </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The accused, <em>A</em>, intends to challenge, at the trial, the voluntariness of his statements made to the police which statements are intended by the prosecution to be admitted as part of its case. <em>A</em> must specify which of the statements he intends to challenge and the facts that he intends to rely on to support his challenge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Consistent with the non-disclosure, I noted that some of the allegations were not even put to the IOs when they took the stand. I therefore drew an adverse inference against the accused under section 221(a) of the CPC and found that the allegations were concocted by the accused and therefore untrue.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In conclusion, I rejected all of Fiona’s allegations of threat, inducement or promise. I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her statement was provided and signed by her voluntarily and I admitted it in evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2)   2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Hearing</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Fiona challenged the admissibility of the next statement recorded from her on 28 October 2016 at 11.30 am by IO Nicholas Djong Nam Hin (“IO Nicholas”). The recording of the statement concluded at 12 noon on the same day. IO Nicholas testified that no threat, inducement or promise was made to Fiona and that the statement was made and signed by her voluntarily.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It was the defence position and also put to IO Nicholas that the statement was involuntary because of the collective threats, inducements and promises made to Fiona by the other IOs on 26<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> October 2016. In other words, the defence was repeating its allegations raised in the 1<sup>st</sup> ancillary hearing. By consent, the parties agreed that the evidence led in the 1<sup>st</sup> ancillary hearing be admitted in the 2<sup>nd</sup> ancillary hearing so that the other IOs who had testified in the 1<sup>st</sup> ancillary hearing need not be recalled to testify to refute the same allegations. Counsel also confirmed that Fiona would not be giving further evidence in this 2<sup>nd</sup> ancillary hearing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The accused did not allege any wrongdoing on the part of IO Nicholas but merely repeated her allegations against the other IOs. Given my findings in respect of Fiona’s allegations for the 1<sup>st</sup> ancillary hearing which are merely repeated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> ancillary hearing, I accordingly found that these allegations were fabricated, unfounded and untrue. Additionally, I also considered that by the following day (27<sup>th</sup> October) after her arrest, her alleged fears would appear to have dissipated because she provided negative statements. When she provided the present statement on 28<sup>th</sup> October, there were no alleged fresh allegations of threat, inducement or promise. Accordingly, the present statement would not have been given as a result of any threat, inducement or promise.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In any event, I rejected all of her repeated allegations of threats, inducements and promises. In the circumstances, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her statement was given voluntarily and I admitted it in evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3)   3rd Ancillary Hearing</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Fiona next contested the voluntariness of two statements recorded from her on:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>a.     1 November 2016 at 11.50 pm; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>b.     4 November 2016 at 11.10 pm.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It was not disputed that these two statements were recorded by IO Tony. The accused challenged the admissibility of the statements on the ground that the statements were “obtained through threats, inducements and/or promises made by IO Tony and were not made voluntarily by the accused.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The threats, inducements, promises and oppressive acts alleged to have caused or committed by IO Tony to render the statements involuntary may be summarised as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>a.     That IO Tony chose to record both statements late in the night;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>b.     That he bragged to the other IOs a few days before (on 27 October 2016) in the earshot of the accused that he would be promoted if he solved the case which gave the impression to the accused that he would ensure that the accused would confess;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"></a>c.     That the accused’s free will was sapped because he showed his displeasure and frustration, including raising his voice, when the accused would not agree with his belief that Pony was the mastermind of a syndicate;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_d"></a>d.     That the accused “felt that she was forced to give him the answers that would vindicate his preconceived notion” of a syndicate;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_e"></a>e.     That the accused was unable to change or be allowed to remove her contact lens for more than five days when she was in police custody, and was therefore in extreme discomfort which “sapped her free will”;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_f"></a>f.     That IO Tony had given her the impression that he was in control and able to prolong the period of her remand. He reinforced this “impression” with unnecessary antics e.g. calling the accused’s mother; telling Fiona details about his personal life which were unconnected to the investigations;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_g"></a>g.     That IO Tony discouraged both the accused and her mother from engaging a lawyer because it would give the court the impression that she was unremorseful or uncooperative. He also misinformed them that the police station would arrange a lawyer for her;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_h"></a>h.     That when Fiona’s mother visited her, he forbade them from discussing about the case thus making sure that they could not discuss the issue of engaging a lawyer;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_i"></a>i.     That IO Tony promised that she would get a lighter sentence if she implicated her uncle, Pony, as the mastermind; and finally</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_j"></a>j.     That IO Tony warned her not to anger him whenever she wanted to amend her statement which led the accused to believe there might be reprisals if she insisted on correcting her statements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Having considered the evidence of IO Tony and that of Fiona and her mother<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>, I rejected all the allegations levelled against IO Tony.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">No threat, inducement, promise or oppression</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I believed IO Tony’s testimony that he did not threaten Fiona or offer any promise or inducement to her. Some of the allegations, even if true, did not amount to threats or oppressive conduct. For example, even if IO Tony kept on repeating his questions, that on its own would not constitute a threat or oppression. In any case, I agree with the prosecution’s oral submission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> that the duration taken to record the two statements (i.e. 3 hours 10 minutes and 1 hour 20 minutes respectively) was entirely consistent with the length of the statements and the number of annexes attached to those statements (i.e. 31 and 9 annexes respectively). The time taken to record the statements also included the time taken by the accused to read over her statements and for her to sign every page of her statements as well as write her NRIC number on the annexes. In other words, I found that the duration taken to record the statements was reasonable and not unduly protracted. The duration taken was certainly not oppressive. Further, given the number of annexes attached to the statements, I also agree with the prosecution that there is nothing sinister or unreasonable, let alone oppressive, about the IO Tony asking many questions or having to repeat his questions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I also did not find that the fact that the statements were recorded late in the night to be oppressive. I accept IO Tony’s explanation that he had to record statements from the other two accused persons throughout the day and in any case, Fiona was well rested before her statements were recorded. I would also think that IO Tony (like any other investigator for that matter) would have to perform myriad other investigative and administrative duties. The accused also accepted that she had nothing to do before her statement was recorded, albeit late in the night. Therefore, there is no reason why she would find it oppressive even if she was asked to give a statement late in the night.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The accused also complained that IO Tony would tell her details about his personal life which were unrelated to the case. Even if he did, I did not see how that would constitute a threat or oppression.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I also believed IO Tony’s testimony that he did not make any promise or offer any inducement to Fiona. I rejected Fiona’s allegation that IO Tony induced her into confessing in order that she would get a lighter sentence of three years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> I agree with prosecution’s submission that there was no need for IO Tony to get himself into trouble by trying to illegally obtain a confession. This was because Fiona had already provided her confessions to IO Eddie and IO Nicholas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The accused again alleged that she was worried that her mother (and by extension, grandmother) would get into trouble because the mobile phone that was used to communicate with the students was registered in her mother’s name. However, this was her own fear arising out of her own action of registering the phone in her mother’s name and using the said phone in the commission of the offences. In other words, she got her mother into trouble by putting her mother in that predicament which caused her to worry for her mother. Her fear and anxiety, if any, was entirely her own making and had nothing to do with IO Tony. In other words, any fear and anxiety stemmed from her feeling guilty for dragging her mother into the situation. Even if IO Tony had capitalised on Fiona’s anxiety for her mother (which I did not find to be the case), Fiona has no one to blame but herself. Ultimately, her fear and worry regarding her mother arose out of her own doing and entirely self-induced. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, the situation is no different from the circumstances in <em>Lu Lai Heng v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 1037.xml')">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 1037</a> where the court held that there was no threat, inducement or promise just because the accused in that case was worried for his mother because the drugs were found in his mother’s room.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Contact lens</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Much of the allegations of oppression centred around Fiona’s complaint that she had to wear her contact lens for up to five days during her remand which caused her immense discomfort. The defence called Fiona’s mother to testify that, even though she was not allowed to see Fiona, she had brought Fiona’s spectacles to the police station to be given to Fiona on 27<sup>th</sup> Oct 2016 i.e. 4 days before Fiona gave her statement on 1 November 2016. The defence accepted that Fiona’s mother had handed over Fiona’s spectacles to the police at the station and that Fiona had her spectacles.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The defence took issue with the fact that the police did not also accept from the mother the contact lens case and contact lens solution. Fiona claimed that even though she had the spectacles, she could not remove her contact lens because she did not have her contact lens case. In effect, she was saying that unless she could properly store her contact lens in a contact lens container (which she was not provided), she could not remove her contact lens. There was some dispute as to whether Fiona finally got her contact lens case before or after she gave her statement on 1 November 2016. I found that that did not matter because I was dumbfounded (as was the learned DPP) by her twisted explanation and logic that she could not remove her contact lens without the container. I found that if the accused did suffer discomfort because of continued use of her contact lens, she only had herself to blame for being so inflexible. In fact, it was not clear if IO Tony was even aware that the lock-up personnel had refused to allow the contact lens case and solution to be given to the accused. I therefore found that there was no oppression on the part of IO Tony on the issue of the contact lens.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I also found that Fiona’s instructions to her counsel contradicted her own testimony.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Thus, while counsel had put to IO Tony (and also made the same submission) that he would not allow Fiona to wear her spectacles<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>, Fiona’s testimony did not go so far as to allege that the IO refused to allow her to remove her contact lens or wear her glasses. Therefore, counsel either misconstrued her instructions or she had given contradictory instructions to him. Either way, this allegation is rejected.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     This was yet another example of the accused vacillating in her allegations against IO Tony, and consistent also with the fact as mentioned above that all these allegations were not disclosed in the CFD.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In summary, I rejected all of the accused’s allegations that the manner and circumstances in which her statements were recorded were oppressive. I also found that no threat, inducement or promise was made to the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Allegations contrived and exaggerated</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Far from being truthful, I found the accused to have over-exaggerated her claims. As rightly pointed out by the learned DPP, her counsel was instructed to put to IO Tony that one of her statements did not end at the time as stated on the statement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In fact, counsel put to IO Tony that he was not truthful<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> i.e. the accused was alleging that the time written on her statement was fabricated. However, IO Tony explained the sequence of events when he was re-examined by the learned DPP. Realising that her allegation was unfounded in light of IO Tony’s explanation, the accused then changed her position and accepted that her statement did conclude at the time as stated on the statement. I agree with the prosecution’s submission that the accused was prone to change and tailor her defence as the prosecution’s evidence unfolded. This is evident from the number of instances of contradictions and inconsistencies between her oral testimony and the questions which counsel put to the witnesses or his submission to the court.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Self-induced fears and self-perceived inducements</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Looking at the manner in which counsel crafted his summary of the accused’s allegations, it was apparent to this court that many of Fiona’s allegations were self-induced fears or self-perceived inducements. I have already highlighted these (with quotation marks) when I set out counsel’s summary of Fiona’s allegations above. For example, counsel submitted that the accused “<em>felt that she was forced to give him the answers that would vindicate his preconceived notion</em> (of a syndicate) <em>and this sapped the free will of the accused</em>.” The submission was therefore that she <em>felt</em> that she was forced and not that she was in fact forced to provide answers. This is shown in the following testimony which was highlighted by the prosecution:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="18.82%"/> <col width="81.18%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Counsel:</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">And then did you agree with him [IO Tony] in the end?</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused:</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The way he is asking question, it feels like I need to agree with him because most of the times its quite late and I am really tired and---and it’s like, it feels like he is never going to stop if I don’t agree with him.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The second part of that sentence is not any clearer and is also illogical because the submission was that because she felt she was forced, that feeling sapped her free will. Here, counsel appears to be confusing and conflating the allegation of threatening behavior with oppressive behavior.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It was also submitted that IO Tony “<em>had given the accused the impression that he was able to artificially prolong her remand</em>.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> This submission stopped short of alleging that the IO in fact threatened to prolong her remand unnecessarily. It was apparent that the fear, if any, that she would be locked up longer than necessary was self-generated. It was her self-induced perception that the interview would be prolonged and not as a result of any threat made to her by IO Tony. It was also obvious to me that the accused was keenly aware of what was going on around her. She testified that she could hear that there was a ‘pasar malam’ outside the police station; that IO Tony was drinking Pokka coffee and apologised for not being able offer her food from the ‘pasar malam’; that the IO made a call to his daughter etc. The fact that she was able to recall these details belied counsel’s submission that “her will was sapped.” The prosecution was right to suggest that the accused was probably feeling more annoyed with the IO than being drained of her willpower.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In truth and in summary, I found that the accused was simply throwing everything but the kitchen sink into her confused mix of spurious allegations. This was apparent from her answers to her counsel during her examination-in-chief as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="16.7%"/> <col width="83.3%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Counsel:</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">So if---if you didn’t agree with him and he doesn’t stop.

He is just going to dragging out until I’m super tired like---and eventually agree with him no matter what…</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The above exchange shows that the accused was merely speculating as to what IO Tony might do her i.e. that he <em>might</em> get angry or violent or drag out the recording. I found that it was because of her self-induced (but ungrounded) fears that she decided to tell the truth.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I agree with prosecution’s submission that the statements were recorded with adequate intervals and that the recording was not prolonged. Thus, the 4<sup>th</sup> November 2016 statement was recorded on the day after the court granted an extension of remand and was only 1 hour and 20 minutes long. I also agree that the 1<sup>st</sup> November 2016 statement could not be said to be prolonged given the large number of annexes and the details therein which the accused had to go through. If the accused had requested for a break (<em>which she did and was given a toilet break for the 4<sup>th</sup> November 2016 statement</em>), I see no reason why IO Tony would have denied her a break. It was no fault of IO Tony that the accused wanted to continue with the statement and not request for more breaks. Therefore, I rejected the accused’s complaint that the statements took too long or that she was tired. In short, just because the accused was not given the creature comforts that she is used to at home would not in itself amount to oppression.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I also noted that some of her allegations are misconceived. For example, counsel submitted that she was not allowed to discuss the case when her mother visited her at the police station. In the first place, the fact that IO Tony even allowed the visit showed that IO Tony was not the monster that the accused had painted him to be. In any case, this allegation, even if true, fell short of what is legally required to render the statements involuntary</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     If the accused had decided to co-operate with the police, it would appear that she did so simply because of her mother’s advice.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Finally, as pointed out by the prosecution, the accused’s allegations were canvassed by the accused for the first time only on 1st April 2019 in the course of the trial. It therefore came as no surprise that counsel again conceded that her allegations were not raised in her CFD filed in court. I agreed with the prosecution that the reticence in the CFD regarding these allegations once again contravened s 217(1)(d) of the CPC. I therefore similarly drew an adverse inference against the accused under s 221(a) of the CPC. I found that the allegations of threat, inducement, promise and oppression were mere after-thoughts and that the alleged fears, if any, were either self-perceived or self-induced.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In conclusion, I was therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the two statements were voluntary and accordingly, the statements were admitted in evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Collective admissions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The prosecution relied on the following admissions which were made by the accused persons in their statements that were admitted in evidence either by consent or after the statements were found to be voluntary statements following an ancillary hearing:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the three accused were aware of and were part of a scheme to assist the students to cheat in the Examination.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     That Pony was the mastermind of the scheme who had decided how the cheating was to be carried out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     That the other co-accused persons and Jia Yan would execute the scheme and act on Pony’s directions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Fiona, Riwen and Jia Yan each had their roles to play. Thus, Jia Yan registered the students for the examination and helped to procure the communication devices to be used for the cheating scheme. Before each examination paper, the students would gather at Zeus and Fiona, Riwen and Jia Yan would assist the students to wear and conceal the communication devices on their bodies. They would also test that the devices were working properly before sending the students off to the examination venues.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Jia Yan and Fiona also registered themselves as private candidates for the Examination. Mostly, Jia Yan would sit for the examination papers in order to provide a live stream of the examination questions to the other accused persons who were stationed in Zeus, and who would then communicate the answers to the students. Pony oversaw the entire process. For one paper (Mathematics Paper 2), the role of Jia Yan and Fiona was reversed because Jia Yan was stronger in the subject and therefore stayed back at Zeus to work out and provide the answers.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Close of Prosecution’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Submission of no case to answer</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Counsels for the three accused submitted that there was no case for the defence to answer primarily because there was no evidence to support one of the elements of all the charges i.e. that the act of concealment of the fact that the students would be receiving remote assistance is one which was “<em>likely to cause harm to SEAB’s reputation.”</em></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The offence of cheating is provided under s 415 of the Penal Code as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whoever, by deceiving any person, whether or not such deception was the sole or main inducement, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver or cause the delivery of any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to any person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to “cheat”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Further, a dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of s 415 of the Penal Code (see Explanation 1).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     With regards to the element of abetment by way of conspiracy under s 109 of the Penal Code, the following additional ingredients need to be proved (<em>Lee Yuen Hong v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 1 SLR(R) 0604.xml')">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 604</a><sup></sup>at [39]):</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_a"></a>(a)     the person abetting must engage with others in a conspiracy;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_b"></a>(b)     the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_c"></a>(c)     an act must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As for the sole charge against each accused under s 417 read with s 116 of the Penal Code, the only difference is that the offence was not committed in consequence of the abetment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It has also been held that there is no necessity for a conspirator to know every single detail of how the abetted offence is to be committed, so long as he knew the purpose of the conspiracy and had participated in it through some act. Although there must be knowledge of a common design, it is also not necessary that all the co-conspirators should be equally informed of the details. They need only be aware of the general purpose of the plan and that the plan is unlawful (<em>Nomura Taiji &amp; Ors v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 2 SLR 173 at [110]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Likelihood to cause reputational harm</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The nub of the defence’s argument is confined only to the element of “harm to SEAB’s reputation” The prosecution referred me to <em>PP v Lim Ek Kian</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6964-M.xml')">[2002] SGDC 331</a> where the District Court had to consider the meaning of the term “harm to reputation” in s 415 of the Penal Code. The accused in that case was the managing director of a company which distributed Skoda cars. He forged an application form to transfer PARF/COE rebate and presented it to a Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) officer thereby inducing the said officer to issue a certificate for the transfer of the rebate from the named car owner to another person. In considering whether there was harm caused to LTA’s reputation, the District Court opined at [91] that it was clear that the accused’s act was likely to cause damage or harm to LTA’s reputation as an effective regulatory body in the eyes of car owners and those in the vehicle industry. The District Court further said that “public regard and confidence in the integrity of LTA’s rebates transfer and registration system is likely to be shaken by the [accused’s] conduct.” The District Court’s finding was upheld on appeal by Yong Pung How CJ in <em>Lim Ek Kian v PP</em> [2003] SGCH 58 who agreed at [31] that the accused’s actions had “compromised the reputation and integrity of the LTA’s system of rebates transfer”, and that this constituted the damage required under the second limb of s 415 of the Penal Code. I find that the views expressed in the said case as regards what constitutes damage or harm to reputation would also apply in the present case to SEAB’s system of administering examinations. It would also appear that there is some nexus between reputation and integrity in that damage or harm to the integrity of a system would invariably result in damage or harm to its reputation. For the avoidance of any doubt, I am also of the view that the two terms “harm” and “damage” would have the same meaning if used in relation to “reputation”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I also took some guidance, as suggested by the prosecution, from Explanation 4 to s 499 of the Penal Code in relation to the offence of defamation:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Explanation 4.—No imputation is said to harm a person’s reputation, unless that imputation directly or indirectly, <b>in the estimation of others</b>, lowers the moral or intellectual character of that person, or lowers the character of that person in respect of his calling, or <b>lowers the credit of that person</b>, or causes it to be believed that the body of that person is in a loathsome state, or in a state generally considered as disgraceful.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I agree with prosecution’s submission that the term “harm to reputation” includes (but is not limited to) acts which would (a) adversely affect the public’s regard and confidence in the integrity of an organisation’s system or process, or (b) result in the lowering of the credit of the organisation in the estimation of others.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evidence of likely harm to reputation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I was satisfied that there was credible evidence adduced by the prosecution to support the element in the charges relating to <em>likelihood of causing harm</em> to the reputation of SEAB.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    As was rightly pointed out by the prosecution, the director of the Assessment Planning and Development Division of the SEAB, Lee Ah Huat (“Lee”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> was called to give evidence that the accused persons’ act in abetting the students to cheat was <em>likely</em> to cause harm – and may in fact have caused harm – to the reputation of SEAB. He testified that the cheating in the Examination represented a “very serious attack [on]…the integrity and fairness of the national examinations” because it was “planned and coordinated by a group using hard-to-detect and concealed communication devices”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Lee further said that while SEAB is constantly cognisant of the “risk posed by emerging technologies such as smart communication devices”, this has to be balanced against providing a conducive test environment for candidates. Those involved in the cheating clearly took advantage of a conducive testing environment in order to gain an unfair advantage over the rest of the candidates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Lee added that if the present cheating had not been detected, “people will be encouraged to do more of it”. This would “compromise the interest of the vast majority of the other candidates who [had] worked very hard to prepare for the examination”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> In light of the improper and unauthorised assistance received by the students involved, their results would not be a “fair reflection of their true achievement level”.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> When the student uses such examination results for progression into institutes of higher learning, such as polytechnics, universities, or employment, both locally and overseas, these institutions, who would have daily interactions with the student, would have serious doubts about the student’s mastery of a certain subject. They would be “trying to reconcile between the real performance and [the] certificate in front of them”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Lee also added that the GCE O Level certifications are well recognised and known for its high academic standards both locally and abroad. However, given the cheating incident which has been widely reported, this would “slowly erode public trust and confidence in the credibility of examination results as well as the fairness of the conduct of national examinations”, which undermines the “good effort that Singapore has put in [to build this image] over the years”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In summary, I found that that Lee’s above explanation constituted evidence that harm is likely to be caused – and may in fact have already been caused – to SEAB’s reputation by the accused persons’ act of providing covert assistance to the students during the Examination. I further considered that this case of examination cheating has captured the attention of overseas media. Therefore, there is little doubt that the integrity of SEAB’s examination invigilation system and its reputation may have been adversely affected. I agree that the act of cheating distorted the level playing field of the candidates who sat for the Examination. The students who had received assistance from the accused persons had an unfair advantage. If they were to use the results to further their education or to advance their career, their prospective schools or employers would see the disparity between the students’ actual performance and what is reflected in their certificate which is endorsed by SEAB. It was also revealed that around 90,000 candidates sit for the GCE O Level examination every year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> These candidates will have legitimate concerns about the integrity and fairness of SEAB’s administration of examinations if cheating went unchecked and becomes widespread. The public (including parents of the candidates) would also be alarmed by such blatant cheating. There is no question that the accused persons’ act was, at the very least, <em>likely</em> to cause a loss of public trust and confidence in SEAB’s administration of a critical national examination. I would agree that SEAB’s reputation, built up over the years, is therefore likely to be damaged, if not already damaged.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence called</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    For the above reasons, I rejected the defence’s legal argument that there was no evidence of harm or likely harm to SEAB’s reputation. I was satisfied that the prosecution had adduced sufficient prima facie evidence which is not inherently incredible, and which constituted some evidence in support of all the elements of the charges. Accordingly, I called on the three accused persons to give their defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Court’s Findings and Decision</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overwhelming evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Although Riwen did not appeal against the conviction, I propose nonetheless for completeness and convenience, to provide and set out the grounds for the conviction of all three accused persons hereinafter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, there was overwhelming evidence against the three accused persons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> The evidence adduced by the prosecution came from multiple material sources (i) the six students whom the accused persons had abetted, (ii) the accused persons’ self-incriminating statements, (iii) Jia Yan (the accomplice), and (iv) corroborative and contemporaneous documentary evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Despite the overwhelming evidence, the three accused persons, in consultation with their counsel, chose to remain silent when called to give their defence. They also did not call any witness for the defence either. In other words, they decided not to challenge the prosecution’s evidence, except only to repeat the same legal arguments in respect of that particular element (i.e. likelihood of harm caused) common to all the charges. I should also add that Riwen did not even appeal against his conviction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I accept the prosecution’s evidence which fully and comprehensively inculpated all three accused persons beyond reasonable doubt. I found that the three accused, along with Jia Yan, did engage in a conspiracy to abet the six students to cheat in the Examination by deceiving and concealing from SEAB the fact that the student would be receiving assistance remotely from outside the examination venue. The prosecution’s evidence revealed and proved beyond reasonable doubt the MO of the accused persons which was that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_a"></a>(a)     The students were asked to report to Zeus before each examination paper so that they would be equipped with the communication devices. The said devices were carefully secured to body by tape and concealed beneath the students’ clothes. The students were also provided with a skin coloured earpiece worn in their ear. The devices were tested and the students were then despatched to the examination venues.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_b"></a>(b)     At the same time, Jia Yan (and Fiona for one paper) also sat for the same paper concurrently with the students. She had her mobile phone taped to her chest beneath her top and she provided a live feed of the examination paper questions using FaceTime to the other accused persons who were stationed at Zeus</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_c"></a>(c)     The accused persons at Zeus will then find/work out the answers and called the students individually and fed them the answers over the earpiece which was connected to their mobile phones via the Bluetooth receiver taped to their bodies.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_d"></a>(d)     This scheme of deception went on for several papers from 19 to 21 October 2016 but Chen Yi was caught cheating during the English Paper 1 examination on 24 October 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    I will again summarise the key aspects of the prosecution’s evidence proving the accused persons’ complicity in the above MO and the events relating to the cheating incidents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Students’ evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    I have earlier summarised the evidence of the six students whose collective evidence was that they cheated at the Examination and that the accused persons and Jia Yan had provided them with remote assistance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> Their evidence cohered largely with one another and unquestionably identified and implicated all three accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I found the five students who had testified in court to be credible and honest and I believed them.

They were instructed to report first to Zeus before proceeding to the examination venues for each paper.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    I accept their evidence that starting from 19 October 2016, they reported to Zeus prior to each examination paper in order for the accused persons (mainly Fiona and Jia Yan) to help them wear and conceal the communication devices on their bodies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> The accused persons also helped them to test the connections. I further accept their evidence that during the examinations, they received calls from the accused persons stationed at Zeus (mainly Fiona and Riwen) who would provide them the answers. They ‘answered’ the calls by activating the Bluetooth receiver strapped to their body which is paired to a similarly concealed mobile phone and earpiece. At the end of each day, they were instructed to return to Zeus where their communication devices would be collected from them to be used for the next day. With the exception of Zhang Jinlu who decided not to cheat any further after the Mathematics Paper 2, the remaining students continue to cheat in this manner until Chen Yi was finally caught.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In the weekend after Mathematics Paper 2 (<em>ie</em>, 22 and 23 October 2016), Zhang Jinlu decided not to sit for the remaining papers because his family felt uncomfortable with the arrangement to cheat. Further, the schedule of the next paper also clashed his school examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    During the next examination (English Paper 1) on 24 October 2016, the equipment that Chen Yi had on his body malfunctioned. As a result, noises emitted when Riwen called him. The noises attracted the attention of the invigilator. After the examination, Chen Yi was brought to an office, where he removed all the devices from his body (i.e. mobile phone, the Bluetooth receivers and the earpiece) and surrendered them to the invigilator and presiding examiners. He was allowed to sit for the English Paper 2. After the English Paper 2 examination, he met with the invigilator and presiding examiners to write down the entire process of what had happened.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> The other four students were at different examination centres and were unaware of this development. They sat for English Papers 1 and 2 with the devices on their bodies and they continued to receive assistance for these papers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The accused persons became worried when they could not contact Chen Yi after the English Paper 2 examination. When Chen Yi finally returned to Zeus, he related what happened to the accused persons. They discussed how to resolve the matter. Pony suggested that Chen Yi return to China that night. Jia Yan then used her credit card to buy an air ticket for Chen Yi, while Pony gave Chen Yi some money. At the same time, Fiona remotely reset Chen Yi’s mobile phone (which had been confiscated by the invigilators). Thereafter, Chen Yi left Singapore for China that very same night.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Counsels for the accused persons initially tried to discredit and fault the students for minor inconsistencies in their evidence. However, as the students took the stand to testify one after another, it became apparent that the students were telling the truth. Correspondingly, counsels’ zeal and efforts in their cross-examination to discredit the students also fizzled out. While counsels were able to point out inconsistencies in the evidence of the students, I find that these were immaterial and inconsequential. The apparent inconsistencies may be explained and resolved away for two reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The <em>first</em> reason is the passage of time of almost three years by the time they gave their evidence. Therefore, it would not be fair or reasonable to expect the students to remember every minute detail of what happened. For example, they were questioned as to whether the communication devices were kept in a box. Such a detail was neither material nor significant enough to leave an impression after several years.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The <em>second</em> reason is that the students testified from their individual perspective which would have been different from each other. For example, the students were first told by Pony that they would be given assistance to cheat during the Examination. Pony called them into his office at different times to speak to them largely individually and separately. The students recalled, to the best of their memory, that Fiona, Riwen and Jia Yan (or some of them) were also in the room. Because they were called separately into the office, it may well be that Fiona, Riwen and Jia Yan were not always present during the briefing. However, the single material and consistent evidential thread which ran through all the students’ testimonies is that it was Pony who had summoned them into her office to inform them that they would be receiving assistance to cheat in the Examination. I accept and find that to be an immutable fact.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    I am aware that there will often be discrepancies and inconsistencies in any witness’s testimony. The students in the present case were no exceptions. However, it has often been said that the court must recognise and give reasonable allowance for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection. In this regard, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <em>Sandz Solutions Strategic and Others v Worldwide Assets Limited</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGCA 0027.xml')">[2014] SGCA 27</a> (“<em>Sandz Solutions Strategic</em>”) at [56] highlighted the danger of over-reliance on the recollection of witnesses on the witness stand. The CA held that a witness should not be judged to be less credible merely because of gaps in his memory, particularly where a long period of time has passed since the occurrence of the events in question. Ultimately, the trial judge is to consider the totality of the evidence in determining the veracity, reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Ultimately, I believed the students and fully accept their testimonies. They were remorseful and regretted cheating in the Examination and even apologised to the court. If the inconsequential inconsistencies, if any, were winnowed out from their evidence, I found that the broad strokes of their testimonies were entirely consistent and proved beyond any doubt that the three accused persons and Jia Yan were complicit in assisting them to cheat at the Examination.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Accused persons’ admissions in statements</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The students’ evidence was corroborated by the full admissions of guilt made by all three accused persons in their police statements. The accused persons admitted their complicity in the plan to assist the six students to cheat in the Examination. The admissions themselves would be have been sufficient evidence, without more, to convict the accused persons of their charges. Further, the statements of one accused may also be considered against the other accused persons as provided in s 258(5) of the CPC since all of them are jointly tried for the same offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Fiona’s statements were admitted in evidence following three ancillary hearings. I found them to be voluntary statements and were accurately recorded. It was never put by Fiona’s counsel to the IOs that the statements were inaccurate and it bears repeating that Fiona remained silent and therefore did not challenge the accuracy of her statements. I gave full weight to the admissions contained therein. As for Pony and Riwen, their statements were admitted in evidence with the consent of their counsels. There were no objections as to the accuracy or voluntariness of the statements. Similarly, Pony and Riwen remained silent and also did not take the stand to dispute the accuracy of the statements. Therefore, there was no question that the statements were voluntary and accurately recorded and I accorded full weight to the admissions contained therein.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The material admissions contained in the statements are summarised by the prosecution which are that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_a"></a>(a)     Pony was paid $8,000 per student by a Chinese agent, one Dong Xin, to provide tuition to the students and to assist the students to pass the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations, and a contract was signed to this effect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_b"></a>(b)     The three accused were aware of the scheme to help the students cheat in the Examination i.e. by remotely providing answers to the students who were wearing earpieces which were paired to their mobile phones by way of Bluetooth devices which were secured to the students’ bodies with tape.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_c"></a>(c)     Pony was the mastermind of the scheme.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> She categorically admitted that she helped the students “cheat” in the Examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> She decided how the cheating was to be carried out.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_d"></a>(d)     The other accused persons and Jia Yan implemented the plan by carrying out Pony’s instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> Jia Yan enrolled the students to sit in the Examination and procured the communication devices. On the day of and before each paper, the three of them would assist the students (who were asked to report to Zeus) to wear and conceal the devices. They also helped the students to test that the devices were working. Jia Yan also registered herself as a private candidate and sat for the papers. She used the mobile application, FaceTime, to provide a live stream of the question papers to the other two accused persons who remained at Zeus and who would work on the questions and remotely communicate the answers to the students on their mobile phones. In respect of one paper (Mathematics Paper 2), Jia Yan and Fiona switched roles because Jia Yan was better at the subject. Pony oversaw the entire process.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_e"></a>(e)     Chen Yi was then caught cheating and Pony sent him on a flight back to China. Pony also refunded some money to Dong Xin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Jia Yan’s evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The accomplice, Jia Yan, decided to plead guilty to her charges before the trial against the accused persons commenced. By the time she took the stand to testify as a prosecution witness, she was already serving her imprisonment sentence. She had appealed against her sentence but withdrew her appeal eventually.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In summary, she testified that the conspiracy to assist students to cheat began on a smaller scale a few years prior to 2016. For the examination in 2016, Pony instructed her to register herself, as well as the six Chinese students, as private candidates. The details of the students, such as the residential addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided to register the students belong to Pony, Fiona and Jia Yan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> Fiona also registered separately as a private candidate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Jia Yan was the one who procured the communication devices. Together with Fiona and Riwen, she would help the students to wear and conceal the communication devices on their bodies. She, too, would strap her mobile phone and other devices on her body and conceal the devices by wearing a jacket. During the examination, she provided a live feed of the examination questions to the other accused persons stationed at Zeus and they would in turn provide the answers to the students by calling them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I accept her evidence which was firm, honest and objective. I believed that she was telling the truth. I was satisfied that she had nothing to gain and had no reason to give false testimony against the accused persons. It also transpired in the course of her testimony, and this was not in dispute, that she had a same-sex relationship with Pony but the relationship had ended some time ago. Counsel for Pony did not cross-exam her much save for a simple, lacklustre put question that she was lying to get back at Pony because of their relationship. However, I easily dismissed that insinuation because they had broken up well before the Examination. Thus, it was not in dispute that Jia Yan continued to work at Zeus as a teacher despite the break-up and she also agreed participate in Pony’s plan to abet the students to cheat in the examination. Therefore, I believed Jia Yan’s testimony that she harboured no ill-will towards Pony and that she spoke the truth regarding the accused persons and herself assisting the students to cheat at the Examination.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   Other objective evidence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    I also agree with prosecution’s submission that there is a string of other surrounding and objective evidence which further corroborate the three sources of evidence already outlined above. These include:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_a"></a>(a)     The communication devices and mobile phone seized from Chen Yi which were identified by the students and the invigilators;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_b"></a>(b)     A photograph of Chen Yi with an exposed Bluetooth device taped to his body.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_c"></a>(c)     The entry proofs of the six students;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_d"></a>(d)     The examination registration details of the students which which belonged to the accused person and Jia Yan rather than the students themselves;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_e"></a>(e)     The attendance records which showed that Fiona and Jia Yan took turns to sit for the Examination;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_f"></a>(f)     The English Paper 1 examination paper which appeared to contain Fiona’s prepared composition answersr<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> and the forensic report extracting these documents from the computers seized from Zeus.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_g"></a>(g)     The English Paper 2 examination paper and a photograph of the locked screen of Chen Yi’s mobile phone showing answers to this paper sent from XXX which is registered to Fiona’s mother;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_h"></a>(h)     The call logs showing received and missed calls from the said number to Chen Yi’s mobile phone during and just after the English Paper 1 examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Remaining silent - adverse inference drawn</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    I have outlined the four bodies of evidence that were adduced by the prosecution against the accused persons. These were more than sufficient to convict the accused persons of all the charges beyond any doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Despite the overwhelming and damning evidence at the close of the prosecution’s case, the accused persons (in consultation with their counsels) chose <em>not</em> to take the witness stand to give their defence. They also did not call any witness to testify for them. The prosecution submitted that an adverse inference must be drawn by the court from the accused persons’ silence, and ultimately, an inference of guilt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> I entirely agree with that submission.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The legal consequence of an accused person choosing not to testify having been called by the court to give his defence, is clearly spelt out in s 291 of the CPC as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    If an accused –</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    after being called by the court to give evidence or after he or the advocate representing him has informed the court that he will give evidence, refuses to be sworn or affirmed; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    having been sworn or affirmed, without good cause refuses to answer any question,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">the court, in deciding whether the accused is guilty of the offence, may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    I am guided by the CA decision in <em>Oh Laye Koh v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/5703-M.xml')">[1994] SGCA 102</a> at [14] – [15] with regards to the drawing of inferences when an accused remains silent:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    Therefore, the trial judge was at liberty to draw any inferences as may appear proper from the failure of the appellant to give evidence on oath, <b><em>including the ultimate adverse inference that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged</em></b><em>.</em> In <em>Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor</em> [1982] 2 MLJ 49, Lord Diplock observed that it would be hopeless to expect jurors or judges, as reasonable men, to refrain from drawing inferences from the accused’s failure to exercise his right to give evidence, including inferences adverse to the accused. After all, <b><em>it is only the accused who is in a position to contradict the evidence of the prosecution on matters that are peculiarly within his knowledge</em></b> or to displace a natural inference as to his mental attitude at the time of the alleged offence that, in the absence of some other explanation, would properly be drawn by any reasonable person from his conduct at that time. However, as Lord Diplock went on to observe at p 53:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">What inferences are proper to be drawn from an accused’s refusal to give evidence depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and it is a question to be decided by applying ordinary commonsense…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    This was rightly recognised by the trial judge at the remitted trial. Essentially, the process would have involved the trial judge’s consideration of whether the totality of the prosecution witnesses’ evidence (as tested in cross examination), together with any inference that could be properly drawn from the accused’s silence, the accused’s guilt could be established beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In truth, I was not too surprised when counsels informed the court that the accused persons had chosen to remain silent. The prosecution’s evidence against them was nothing short of overwhelming. It was already apparent to me, as the last of the students took the stand to testify and corroborate one another that the accused persons had assisted them to cheat at the Examination, that the intensity of the cross-examination of the students had waned and fizzled out. This was no doubt and in no small part due to the sheer honesty and credibility of the students’ evidence. Thereafter, even though Fiona challenged the voluntariness of her statements, these were eventually admitted in evidence after successive ancillary hearings. Pony and Riwen did not object to the admissibility of their statements even though these contained full admissions of their guilt. Finally, Jia Yan, their accomplice, also testified against and implicated the accused persons, further corroborating the students’ evidence and confirming the details of the positive statements thus cementing the prosecution’s case against them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Despite all the evidence stacked against them, the accused persons decided to remain silent and not to give their defence. In effect, they have refused to testify and have decided not to refute the evidence of the 21 prosecution witnesses, including the SEAB officers who testified to the fact that one of the students (Chen Yi) was caught cheating by using the communication devices<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>. Materially and also in effect, the accused persons have decided not to challenge the accuracy of the recording of their statements (and consequently the admissions and confessions therein) which have been admitted in evidence. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, they have chosen not to challenge any of the prosecution’s evidence despite the fact that they alone were in a position to contradict the evidence of the prosecution on matters that are peculiarly within their knowledge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In view of the above considerations, I drew a number of irresistible inferences. In respect of the accused persons’ statements, I have already found them to be voluntary statements. This was, in fact, not an issue with Pony’s and Riwen’s statements which were admitted with the consent of their counsels. As regards the accuracy of the statements, I drew the inference that all the statements were accurately recorded from the accused persons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    I also drew the inference, in light of their choice to remain silent, that they had no defence to all of the charges. Considering the substantial, comprehensive and compelling evidence adduced against them which included their full admissions and confessions no less, I drew the ultimate inference of guilt against all three accused persons in respect of all the charges.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence closing submissions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    I considered the closing submissions of the three accused persons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> In the main, counsels for the three accused persons repeated the legal arguments canvassed at the close of the prosecution that the ingredients of the charges are not made out. These legal arguments are similarly rejected as I had rejected them at the close of the prosecution’s case. I summarise the main arguments and my reasons for rejecting them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    First of all, the defence argued that a dishonest concealment of a fact cannot amount to deception unless there is a legal obligation to disclose owed by one party to the other. The defence cited as authority the case in <em>Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0227.xml')">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 227</a>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> However, I agree with prosecution’s submission that the said case does not support the defence’s argument in that it does not stand for the proposition that there must be a legal obligation to disclose between the parties. The defence is unable to refer to any portion of that judgement to support their legal proposition of a requirement of a pre-existing legal obligation to disclose in order to make out an offence of cheating. Accordingly, I rejected the argument.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The defence also argued that SEAB had not been deceived because despite Chen Yi being caught cheating, SEAB nonetheless forwarded Chen Yi’s examination script to Cambridge for marking.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> This argument is flawed. SEAB’s explanation, which I accept, is that Chen Yi’s script was forwarded to Cambridge for marking along with the scripts of all the candidates because of a tight schedule. Furthermore, the investigations by the authorities into the cheating was still ongoing. In other words, SEAB would not have accepted a student’s script for marking, if they knew that the student had cheated by receiving assistance during the examinations. In the case of Chen Yi’s script, SEAB sent it for marking only as a provisional measure pending the police investigations. It was not the case that the paper was sent for marking despite the fact that Chen Yi had cheated. In fact, if the invigilators had known that the student was wearing the communication devices, they would not even have allowed the student to enter the exam hall, let alone sit for the paper. In the present case, the invigilators were deceived into allowing the students to sit for the examination because the accused persons had assisted them to wear and conceal the communication devices and thereafter to provide remote assistance to them during the examination. I am satisfied and found that SEAB and its invigilators would not have allowed the students to sit for the examination had they not been so deceived.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Ultimately, I am satisfied that the language of s 415 of the Penal Code which provides for the offence of cheating, does not stipulate any requirement for a pre-existing legal duty to disclose material facts. A dishonest concealment of facts, with or without an underlying legal obligation of disclosure, would in or of itself constitute a deception within the meaning of s 415 of the Penal Code.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    I agree with prosecution’s submission that even if there is a requirement for an antecedent obligation of disclosure, I find that the students would have been obliged to disclose that they were wearing communication devices so as to receive assistance from the accused persons during the examination. This is because the students, having registered for the examination, would have been subject to the registration rules of the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination which disallows the students from bringing unauthorised materials or electronic devices (including their mobile phones) into the examination venue. The accused persons had abetted the students to circumvent and flout those rules so that they could receive remote assistance from the accused persons. Therefore, it was entirely disingenuous of the defence to submit that there was no underlying or antecedent obligation of disclosure on the part of the students.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    I also rejected the argument that the cheating did not or was not likely to cause harm to SEAB’s reputation. In this regard, I accept the evidence of the Director of the Assessment Planning and Development Division of SEAB, Lee, who underscored the importance of safeguarding the integrity of the examination system and to maintain public trust and confidence in SEAB’s administration of examinations. He further testified that the accused persons’ act in abetting the students to cheat was likely to cause harm – and may in fact have caused harm – to the reputation of SEAB. Given the international and domestic media publicity that this case has attracted, I have no doubt and I find that reputational harm has, in fact, been caused to SEAB’s reputation.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    I believed and accept the evidence of all the prosecution witnesses to be credible and truthful, particularly the evidence of the students and Jia Yan. Notwithstanding all the evidence, the accused persons chose to remain silent and ultimately did not challenge the prosecution’s evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    I also accept and find that all the statements of the accused persons were voluntary statements and had been accurately recorded. I gave full weight to the statements which contained admissions and confessions as to their complicity and guilt in respect of the charges. The statements further corroborate the evidence of the students and Jia Yan, and also constitute incriminating evidence between the accused persons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In the face of all the evidence, the accused persons elected to remain silent and did not rebut the said evidence adduced.

and if the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Therefore, the prescribed punishment for each offence is up to three years’ imprisonment or a fine or both if the act abetted was committed, and up to only nine months’ imprisonment or a fine or both, if the act abetted was not committed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    The prosecution’s position on sentence is tabulated below which also sets out, in comparison, the sentence received by the accomplice, Jia Yan:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span></p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="15.88%"/> <col width="20.64%"/> <col width="22.22%"/> <col width="22.22%"/> <col width="19.04%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Poh Yuan Nie</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Poh Min Fiona</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Feng Riwen</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Compare:</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Tan Jia Yan </b> <b><em>(PG, appeal lapsed)</em></b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>S 417 r/w</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>s 109 Penal Code</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 months’ imprisonment per charge </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>4 sentences to run consecutively</em> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9 months’ imprisonment per charge </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>4 sentences to run consecutively</em> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 months’ imprisonment per charge </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>4 sentences to run consecutively</em> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9 months’ imprisonment per charge</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>4 sentences to run consecutively</em> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>S 417 r/w</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>s 116</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Penal Code</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 weeks’ imprisonment </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 weeks’ imprisonment </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 weeks’ imprisonment </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9 weeks’ imprisonment </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Global sentence</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">52 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36 months’ imprisonment </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 months’ imprisonment </p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36 months’ imprisonment </p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation &amp;

Counsel also submitted that even though Pony claimed trial to his charges, this ought not to be considered as an aggravating factor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Counsel for Fiona asked that his client be placed on probation on the basis that the principle of rehabilitation was “highly persuasive” and ought to apply to Fiona.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> Yet, in the same breath, counsel mitigated that rehabilitation had already been achieved because she has not reoffended since the commission of the present offences. Unfortunately, counsel could not have been more misconceived if he was not already confused. As I will explain below, the principle of deterrence is the most appropriate sentencing consideration in this case and rehabilitation was furthest from my mind. In the first place, as conceded by counsel, the principle of rehabilitation would generally, and invariably, be the dominant sentencing consideration only for young offenders. Fiona was 33 years old when she was sentenced and therefore cannot be considered a young offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    More importantly, I observed and find that Fiona was the most unapologetic and unremorseful of the three accused persons. Not only did she claim trial to the charges, she was the only accused who contested the voluntariness of all her statements. In the process, she went on to make baseless and spurious allegations against every police officer with whom she had come into contact during the course of the investigations. She continues to remain unrepentant having filed this appeal against her conviction and sentence. In other words, she continues to delude herself that she had done nothing unlawful. Contrary to what counsel has stated in his mitigation plea, she continues to deny any responsibility for her wrongdoing. Given her lack of remorse and persistent denial of her guilt, I do not see how she could be said to have been rehabilitated or that rehabilitation was even appropriate in her circumstances. Counsel then submitted that if the court did not agree with the option of probation, perhaps a fine or a global imprisonment term not exceeding six months would be fair. In my mind, a fine would be wholly inappropriate and six months’ imprisonment would be manifestly inadequate for reasons stated hereinafter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Finally, counsel for Riwen informed that he was 28 years old and a PRC national like the other students. He came to Singapore to study when he was 14 years old and was cared for by Pony and her family. He has a bachelor’s degree in business which he obtained in Australia in 2013.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Counsel stressed that no monetary loss was caused in this case and therefore, Riwen should only be given a fine or at the most, an aggregate imprisonment sentence of no more than two months.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> I am unable to agree with counsel’s mitigation simply because counsel has conveniently sidestepped the fact, which will be elaborated below, that the offences have caused reputational harm to the image of both Singapore and SEAB.

Our education system is intended to be the social leveller by affording equal opportunity for upward social mobility to everyone regardless of race, family background or financial means.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    This case caught the attention of both local and international media. A casual internet search would easily attest to the fact of extensive media coverage. In their written submission, the prosecution has also provided a list of internet links to various media articles. Clearly, this case had caused some degree of public interest and disquiet.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> Members of the public, especially parents with school going children, would most certainly have been aghast by the idea that the students in this case had tried to buy a backdoor pass to get ahead when everyone else had to pass the examination solely on their own merit. The accused persons have scandalised the administration of the GCE O Level examination in mocking the invigilators by cheating under their noses. I absolutely agree with the views expressed by SEAB during the trial that the offences would erode the public trust and confidence in the credibility of examination results in Singapore as well as the fairness of the conduct of national examinations. The offences undermine the efforts that Singapore has expended to build our image, branding and reputation over the years as an education hub.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> Such offences, if unchecked, also devalue the worth of the GCE O Level certificates in the sense that the results would not match the actual abilities of the candidate holding that certificate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I would also add that such offences adversely affect other honest and hardworking students because they would end up having to compete with undeserving students with similar but fraudulently obtained grades for limited places in tertiary schools and ultimately job vacancies. In other words, such offences skew the level-playing field in favour of the cheaters.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Therefore, the court must impose an appropriately severe and deterrent sentence on the three accused which would sufficiently reflect the reputational harm caused to SEAB and Singapore, and the culpability of the accused persons in hatching and carrying out the scheme to assist the students to cheat in the Examination. The sentence must also resonate with the public’s shock at such bold acts which strike at the heart of the principles of fairness, equality and meritocracy that have been so ingrained in every Singaporean. I would therefore respectfully echo the sentiment expressed by my colleague in the District Court (the “DJ”) who had sentenced the accomplice, Jia Yan, that “[t]he sentence must be calibrated not just to punish the wrongdoer appropriately. It must rectify the wrong caused to the system, and present a sufficiently stark warning to deter those who would seek to profit by way of such audacious deception.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2)   Aggravating factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    I considered and agree with the prosecution that the following aggravating factors featured in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    As observed by the High Court in <em>Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/53209-M.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR 334</a> (“<em>Fernando Payagala</em>”) at [40], a deterrent sentence would generally be <em>de rigueur</em> if an offence is committed with premeditation and planning. The High Court went on to note at [42] that “a sophisticated offence replete with carefully orchestrated efforts and steps to avoid detection is an aggravating factor in sentencing.” Further, the High Court in <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> (“<em>Law Aik Meng</em>”) said at [22] that specific deterrence would also be relevant to an offender who makes a conscious choice to commit crimes. Finally, it was held in <em>Chan Chun Hong v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18991-SSP.xml')">[2016] 3 SLR 465</a> at [51(c)(ii)] that the difficulty in detecting an offence or type of offence would also justify a deterrent sentence to discourage would-be offenders from taking risks hoping that their crime would not be detected.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    There is no doubt on the facts of the present case that the offences were committed pursuant to a sophisticated plan hatched by Pony and which involved all the teachers at Zeus working together to help their students cheat in the Examination. With the use of various communication devices that were connected by Bluetooth technology, the accused persons managed to abet six students at any one paper and over several days. The use of Bluetooth technology to pair the devices also enabled the communication devices to be cleverly hidden under the wearer’s clothes to avoid detection. The accused persons further provided the students with earpieces that were small and skin-coloured and therefore barely noticeable when worn in the ear canal. In fact, the cheating had gone on for days without being uncovered until the invigilator heard sounds emanating from Chen Yi’s earpiece.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The sophisticated use of technology also enabled a live stream of the examination questions to be sent to the accused persons stationed in Zeus. The coordination required the teachers to be present simultaneously at Zeus and at the examination venue and to communicate with each other using mobile communication devices so that answers may be worked out in real time and then remotely communicated to the students who were sitting for the papers. There was therefore much careful planning, premeditation and coordination involved.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Another aggravating factor, which is illustrative of the fact of co-ordination highlighted above, is the large number of offences committed by the accused persons. As pointed out by the court in <em>Fernando Payagala</em> at [46], it is a matter of both common sense and general principle that the larger the number of offences committed, the longer the custodial sentence ought to be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    In addition, I considered the aggravating factor that the offences had tarnished the reputation of SEAB, a statutory board and hence a public institution (see <em>Law Aik Meng</em> at [25(a)]). The offences have, to some degree, undermined the public trust and confidence in SEAB’s administration of national examinations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Finally, it was also highlighted by the court in <em>Law Aik Meng</em> at [24(c)] that public disquiet is a particular circumstance of an offence which attracts the principle of general deterrence. Given the scandal caused by the accused persons and the media coverage of the case both internationally and domestically, I completely agree with the prosecution that the offences have damaged Singapore’s reputation as an education hub and caused much public disquiet. At the same time, the offences have struck a blow to Singapore’s bedrock principals of fairness, equality and meritocracy.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    All the above highlighted circumstances were aggravating factors which justified a deterrent sentence, both specifically and generally. There is therefore significant public interest to send a strong signal to like-minded offenders that such offences will be punished severely.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3)   Sentencing precedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    I considered the sentencing precedents tendered by the prosecution in respect of offences of cheating, which included Jia Yan’s case. Counsels for the accused persons either did not present any sentencing precedents for my consideration or cited precedents which were irrelevant to the nature and circumstances of the present case. For example, counsel for Fiona cited cases of offenders lying to or giving false information to the police.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> I did not view these precedents to be even remotely relevant to the present offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Except for Jia Yan’s case which is strictly not a precedent, I did not find the other precedents cited by the prosecution to be particularly helpful. The present case is one of academic dishonesty and fraud that is unprecedented in terms of its nature and scale. The precedents cited included cases of accused persons paying others to take a driving theory test or a physical fitness test in their place. While there is some similarity to the present case in that there was some form of unauthorised assistance in the taking of tests, the nature and significance of the tests and the manner of assistance in the present case are quite different and altogether on a different level. As correctly observed by the DJ in <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> at [42], the benefit obtained as a result of the cheating offences in the present case is of far greater significance in that the GCE O-Level examination is a foundational examination that determines a student’s post-secondary academic route. It is also a basic qualification that is required for job applications. Therefore, the examination results have a far longer and wider significance as compared to the passing of a fitness test or a driving theory test. I would also add that the scale of cheating is also incomparable in the present case because the scheme to cheat involved the principal and the entire academic staff of a tuition centre.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(4)   Parity in sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    The principle of parity in sentencing has two applications: (i) the narrower application to co-offenders who face the same charges and (ii) the wider application to accused persons who face different charges but who, in substance, may be said to be co-participants of a “common criminal enterprise.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> The narrower application of the parity principle was explained by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Public Prosecutor v Ng Sae Kiat</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17701-SSP.xml')">[2015] SGHC 191</a> at [74]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The oft-cited pronouncement on the scope and effect of the parity principle as it applies in Singapore is found in <em>Public Prosecutor v Ramlee</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0095.xml')">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 95</a>. In that case Yong Pung How CJ stated at [7]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the <em>same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances</em>… An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in isolation are not considered manifestly excessive: see <em>R v Walsh</em> (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 224. In <em>R v Fawcett</em> (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 158, Lawton LJ held that the test was whether "right-thinking members of the public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, learning of this sentence consider that something had gone wrong with the administration of justice?" …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">This statement of principle seems to confine the operation of the parity principle to cases where co-offenders are charged with the same offence arising from the same transaction or events, but are dealt with in separate criminal proceedings. This is a <em>par excellence</em> situation where there ought to be parity in the sentences which are meted out to the co-offenders except where there are relevant differences in “their responsibility for the offence or [in] their personal circumstances”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    In a subsequent decision in <em>Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18572-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 25</a>, Menon CJ reiterated at [1] that the principle of parity in sentencing between co-offenders urges those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    In the present case, all the accused persons and Jia Yan faced the same charges. Therefore, the narrower facet of the parity principle would apply in that they ought to receive the same or very similar sentences unless their culpability and personal circumstances were different.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    In the present case, I find that their culpabilities were, in fact, different. Having regard to the evidence of their respective roles, I am satisfied and I find that Pony was the mastermind of the conspiracy. This finding is consistent with her position as the principal of Zeus whereas the other accused persons and Jia Yan were teachers working for her. I find that Pony had devised the scheme to help her students to cheat. It was done for financial benefit and being the principal of the school, she stood to gain the most financially. I would add that it is an aggravating factor (at least for Pony) to commit an offence for financial gain. The other accused persons and Jia Yan carried out her directions. That was indeed prosecution’s case against Pony but she chose not to deny that fact by remaining silent when her defence was called. Accordingly, I am of the view that Pony ought to receive the most severe sentence amongst the four of them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    As for Fiona and Riwen, I would peg their culpability to be lower than that of Pony. They were the teachers working for Pony and who carried out his instructions. Between Fiona and Riwen, I find that Fiona (and similarly Jia Yan) was more involved in preparing and assisting the students to cheat and therefore, more culpable than Riwen. As such, Fiona ought to receive a higher sentence than Riwen.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(5)   No sentencing discount warranted</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    I also considered that because the three accused persons had contested their charges, they would forfeit any sentencing discount which they might have been entitled. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Taufiq bin Djumadi</em> (MA 9258 of 2016), the accused’s original sentence of a fine was set aside on appeal and substituted with a jail sentence. In his oral judgment at [4], See J considered, amongst other factors, that the accused in that case had claimed trial to his charge and did not show any sign of remorse. Therefore, the fact that an accused is unremorseful and chooses to claim trial to his charge(s) is a relevant consideration (though not amounting to an aggravating factor) in deciding on the appropriate sentence. In the present case, the choice made by the three accused persons to claim trial to their respective charges is especially poignant because they also decided not to give their defence at the conclusion of the prosecution’s case which spanned more than 20 days. Clearly, they had no defence or were simply putting the prosecution to strict proof. Either way, they were unremorseful. Further, two of the accused persons (Pony and Fiona) have also appealed against their conviction of their respective charges despite not giving their defence. Their act of dragging out the proceedings against them further demonstrates their lack of remorse in continuing to deny their guilt and obstinately refusing to take responsibility for their criminal acts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Jia Yan was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment for each charge under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code, with four of the imprisonment sentences ordered to run consecutively adding up to a total sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment. The DJ gave her a sentencing discount because she pleaded guilty, albeit not as much as if she had pleaded guilty earlier rather than on the first day of her scheduled trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> The DJ also considered that Jia Yan was not the mastermind.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    The mastermind was indeed Pony. That was the prosecution’s case against her and she had chosen not to deny that fact by remaining silent. In view of her undisputed larger role and her lack of remorse in claiming trial to her charges, her individual and aggregate sentences must surely be pegged much higher in relation to Jia Yan, and even to Fiona and Riwen. That said, I adjusted Pony’s sentence slightly downwards in view of counsel’s mitigation that she had a heart condition. However, it did not justify a substantial discount because it was not a life-threatening condition and there is nothing to show that the prison authorities were unable to adequately manage her condition.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In respect of Fiona and Riwen, the prosecution did not submit for a sentence higher than Jia Yan’s sentence. In fact, for Riwen, the prosecution sought a lower sentence than what was imposed on Jia Yan even though Riwen would not be getting a sentencing discount.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(6)   Aggregate sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    I agree with prosecution’s submission to run four imprisonment sentences consecutively. In coming to that decision, I considered the principles and framework set out by Menon CJ in <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0034.xml')">[2014] SGHC 34</a> (“<em>Shouffee</em>”). In summary, I was guided by the following key principles enunciated in <em>Shouffee</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_183-p2_a"></a>(a)     The <em>one-transaction rule</em> that sentences for offences which form part of a single transaction ought not to be ordered to run consecutively, especially if the various offences involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. However, this is not a rigid rule and regard must be made in a common-sensical way to factors such as proximity in time, proximity of purpose, proximity of location of the offences, continuity of design and unity of protected interests; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_183-p2_b"></a>(b)     The <em>totality principle</em> which is essentially a manifestation of the over-arching requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions. The totality principle comprises two limbs:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_183-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       Whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed; and</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_183-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Whether the overall sentence is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospect.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    In my judgment, the aggregate imprisonment sentences imposed respectively on the accused persons were condign and did not breach the totality principle for the following reasons. First, I considered, as did the DJ in <em>Tan Jia Yan</em> at [52], that the aggregate sentences that prosecution submitted for Fiona and Riwen would not exceed the maximum sentence that can be imposed on a single charge of cheating under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. For Pony, the aggregate sentence sought by the prosecution did not substantially exceed that same maximum sentence. I also agree with the DJ that where multiple charges are involved (there being 27 charges in this case for each accused), it would be rather artificial to be constrained by the maximum sentence provided for the “most serious offence” (see <em>Navaseelan Balasingam v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/52769-M.xml')">[2007] 1 SLR 767</a> at [27]). To be so restricted would be to ignore the increased culpability of the present accused persons as reflected by the multiple offences committed and the brazen manner in which the offences were committed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Secondly, I was satisfied that the respective aggregate sentences were far from crushing on relatively young adults like Fiona and Riwen. Even for Pony who was 55 years old at the time of his sentence, it would still be a stretch to consider his aggregate sentence to be crushing. Thirdly, I also considered that the aggregate sentences were consistent with and, in the case of Pony, deservedly highly than the individual and global sentences received by the accomplice, Jia Yan, who had pleaded guilty.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    For the above reasons, I sentenced the accused persons to their respective cumulative and consecutive sentences. I am satisfied that the respective aggregate sentence is neither crushing nor disproportionate to the accused persons’ individual culpability, the gravity of the charges and the aggravating circumstances of this case, including the reputational harm caused to the Singapore’s reputation as an education hub in general and to SEAB’s invigilation processes in particular.</p> <p
