employed by Hawksford Singapore Pte Ltd (“Hawksford”). Hawksford is a Registered Filing Agent (“RFA”), regulated under the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act (Cap. 2A) and its subsidiary legislation. In the ordinary course of its business, an RFA carries out transactions (for example, filings) with the Registrar of Companies (the “Registrar”) on behalf of its clients. The accused is a director of 241 companies, all of which are clients of Hawksford. She was so appointed for the purpose of complying with the local resident director requirement under Section 145(1) of the Companies Act (the “Act”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Company directors must comply with a number of statutory obligations under the Act including:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     Section 175(4) of the Act which requires every company to hold an Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) after the end of each financial year; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Section 197(1) of the Act which requires the company to lodge the annual return with the Registrar after the AGM has been held, within the stipulated timeframe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Where the company is in default of either obligation, both the company and its officers will be held liable. The maximum punishment for failing to comply with either obligation is a fine of up to S$5,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The accused pleaded guilty to eight charges. Four charges were in respect of the offence under Section 175(1) read with Section 408(3) of the Act; another four charges were for the offence under Section 197(1) read with Section 408(3) of the Act. Section 408(3) of the Act provides that</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">408(3) – For the purposes of any provision of this Act which provides that an officer of a company or corporation who is in default is guilty of an offence under this Act or is liable to a penalty or punishment, the phrase “officer who is in default” or any like phrase means any officer of the company or corporation who knowingly and wilfully –</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    is guilty of the offence; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    authorises or permits the commission of the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The accused consented to 18 further charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing – 9 charges apiece for the offences under Sections 175(1) and 197(1) of the Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Having considered parties’ respective submissions, I impose a fine of S$1,500 (with a default imprisonment term of 5 days) for each charge. The total fine is S$12,000 (with a default imprisonment of 40 days). My reasons for imposing this sentence are as set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The precedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I had requested parties to make submissions on the appropriate sentencing approach for prosecutions brought under Sections 175(1) and 197(1) of the Act. This was because the available precedents did not provide useful guidance as to the how the appropriate sentence was to be calibrated. A survey of the authorities, comprising reported and unreported decisions, revealed that a range of fines, from S$500 to S$2,100 per charge, had previously been imposed in cases involving first-time offenders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The wide range of fines imposed made it difficult to distil any consistent sentencing rationale. It appeared that in cases where the accused persons faced more charges, the fine imposed per charge was higher. This is unsound in law. Furthermore, insofar as the unreported cases are concerned, they are of little or no precedential value.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The reported decisions were, similarly, unhelpful. They were either dated authorities or had scant analysis as to how the sentence was arrived at. For completeness, I will consider each in turn.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In <em>PP v Lam Sau Sang</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/51634-M.xml')">[2006] SGDC 248</a> (<em>Lam Sau Sang</em>”), the accused faced one charge apiece for the offences under Sections 175(1) and 197(1) of the Act. The accused had a prior conviction in respect of the same offences in 2002. The District Judge imposed a fine of S$800 for each charge, noting as follows (at [5]:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The maximum sentence for both the offences under the Companies Act is a sum of $5,000. <b>The normal tariff for a departmental summons is about $500 - $600</b>. Noting that the Accused had a previous conviction (in 2002) which was <em>prior</em> to the date of the offences in these current charges before me, for which he was fined $600, I considered a fine of $800 on each of the charges to be a fair sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>PP v Josephat Albert Thomas Fernandez</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/60572-M.xml')">[2009] SGDC 42</a> (“<em>Josephat</em>”), the accused was convicted after trial on two charges for the offences under Sections 175(1) and 197(1) of the Act. Taking into account the “<em>mitigating factors raised and the accused’s poor health</em>”, the District Judge (at [22]) imposed a fine of S$600 for each charge. The reported decision, however, did not set out what any of these mitigating factors were.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>PP v Tan Pek Har</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17507-SSP.xml')">[2014] SGDC 146</a> (“<em>Tan Pek Har</em>”), the accused pleaded guilty to four charges under Section 175(1) of the Act, and four charges under Section 197(4) of the Act. The District Judge imposed a fine of S$800 per charge, noting (at [11] and (14) as follows: -</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11     <b>A conviction under Section 175(4) or Section 197(7) of the Companies Act would typically warrant a fine of S$800.00 with a default term of imprisonment of 4 days.</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    I was thus unable to find that the accused faced significant financial difficulties, much less financial difficulties exceptional or extreme enough to have any significant bearing as a mitigating factor <b>to justify a departure from the usual fine of S$800.00 per charge</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Finally, in <em>PP v Tan Hang Song</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22948-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 52</a> (“<em>Tan Hang Song</em>”), the accused claimed trial to 54 counts of knowingly and wilfully permitting the companies of which he was a director to default on their statutory obligations, namely, those imposed in Sections 175(1) and 197(1) of the Act. He was convicted at the close of trial and a fine of S$2,100 was imposed per charge. The total fine amounted to S$113,400. The accused lodged an appeal only against the conviction, but subsequently withdrew the appeal. The reported decision does not touch on the reasons for the imposition of the sentence and is unhelpful in this regard.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Attempting to reconcile the remaining reported decisions, it would appear that when <em>Lam Sau Sang</em> was decided in 2006, the usual fine for an offence under Section 175 or 197 for a first offender was S$500 to S$600. By the time <em>Tan Pek Har</em> was decided, the usual fine amount was increased to S$800.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appropriate sentencing approach </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Over the years, the Singapore Courts have developed a number of sentencing approaches. These include the “single starting point” approach, “multiple starting points” approach, the “benchmark” approach, the “sentencing matrix” approach and the “two-step sentencing bands” approach. An overview of these approaches can be found in the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20745-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 449</a> (“<em>Terence Ng</em>”). For present purposes, I will only consider the single starting point approach. This is because parties are on common ground that this is the most appropriate approach for offences under Section 175(1) and Section 197(1) of the Act and I agree with the same. The single starting point approach also appears to have been employed by the courts in <em>Lam Sau Sang</em>, <em>Jesophat</em>, and <em>Tan Pek Har</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The single starting point approach calls for the identification of a notional starting point which will then be adjusted taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors in the case (<em>Terence Ng</em> at [27]). The Court of Appeal in <em>Terence Ng</em> held, at [28], that:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our judgment, the single starting point approach would be suitable where the offence in question almost invariably manifests itself in a particular way and the range of sentencing considerations is circumscribed. This might be the case, for instance, where one is concerned with a regulatory offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At the outset, there is no explanation from either party as to why they characterise the offences in question as regulatory offences. Parties seem to be content that they are so. There appears to be no precise definition of a ‘regulatory offence’. That the offences are prosecuted by a governmental agency does not <em>ipso facto</em> make them regulatory offences. Without laying down any precise definition of what a regulatory offence is, my view is that unlike ‘true crimes’ which have a fault or moral blameworthiness element, regulatory offences typically involve enforcing standards of conduct or behaviour in a specialised area of activity, for example, environmental protection, food safety, education etc. Regulatory offences tend to be concerned with the prevention of harm or certain consequences through such enforcement of minimum standards of conduct whereas criminal offences are designed to condemn and punish past wrongful conduct.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The requirements for companies to hold their AGMs and to lodge their Annual Returns are intended to protect the companies’ stakeholders. The AGM allows the company’s shareholders to be updated on, amongst other things, the financial health and the progress of the company. It is the forum at which shareholders can raise queries, vote and participate in certain key decisions of the company such as approving the company’s financial statements and the appointment of the company’s directors. The Annual Return, on the other hand, contains information about the company including the particulars of the officers, the company’s share capital and its financial health. The lodgement of the Annual Return ensures that such basic information about the company is kept updated and readily available to shareholders and investors. It can therefore be seen that the offences in Sections 175 and 197 of the Act seek to enforce a certain standard of conduct in respect of directors and are, as such, regulatory in nature.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     However, I do not think the mere fact that an offence is regulatory in nature necessarily means that the single starting point should be taken as the sentencing approach. As the Court of Appeal pointed out in <em>Terence Ng</em>, the question is whether the offences “<em>invariably manifests itself in a particular way and the range of sentencing considerations is circumscribed</em>”. This may be characteristic of many types of regulatory offences but certainly not all.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I accept that insofar as the offences in Sections 175(1) and 197 of the Act are concerned, they would manifest themselves in a particular way, and the range of sentencing considerations is circumscribed. Both offences are committed simply through the default of the director in holding the company AGM and lodging the Annual Return within the stipulated timeframe. I cannot see any other way in which the offence would manifest. As regards Section 197 of the Act, as the defence rightly submitted, the offence would invariably be committed if the AGM is not held since the lodgement of the Annual Return is dependent on the AGM being held.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The range of sentencing considerations for the offences in Sections 175(1) and 197(1) is also circumscribed. The gravity of the offending does not depend on a multitude of factors. Harm resulting from the breaches, if any, is likely to be the same in most cases. As for the offender-specific considerations, the usual aggravating and mitigating factors would be applicable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I now turn to identify the notional starting point for offences under Section 175(1) and 197(1) of the Act. In my view, the notional starting point for both offences should be a fine of S$900. First, considering the maximum fine for both sentences is S$5,000, a fine of S$900 as the notional starting point would allow room for upwards adjustments in more aggravated cases. Second, regulatory offences prosecuted by ACRA are typically first mentioned in the Night Courts. Where the case cannot be resolved expeditiously in the Night Courts, the case will then be fixed for mention in the day court for case management. The usual tariff for offences under Section 175(1) and 197(1) of the Act in the Night Courts is a fine of S$700. The usual tariff in the Night Courts is typically lower than in the day court to encourage defendants to resolve their cases at an early stage. With this in mind, a fine of S$900 would appear to be an appropriate notional starting point for the offences in question. Lastly, I am of the view that a fine of S$900 as a notional starting point would strike a balance between the need to ensure that directors take their obligations under the Act seriously and also in cognisance of the fact that the duties imposed in Sections 175 and 197 of the Act are regulatory in nature after all.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Adjustments to the notional starting point </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The next stage of the single starting point approach would be to determine if any adjustments should be made to the notional or indicative starting point, having regard to the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors. This would include both offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In reliance on the decision in <em>Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18022-SSP.xml')">[2015] 5 SLR 122</a> (“<em>Vasentha</em>”), the prosecution submitted that the notional starting point should first be adjusted depending on the level of culpability of the defendant. A further round of adjustments would subsequently be made to account for the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The prosecution proposed a framework for assessing an offender’s culpability in respect of offences under Sections 175 and 197. The framework is based on the offender’s role and involvement in the offence, his motive and circumstances in which he came to be involved in the commission of the offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> As regards the role and involvement of the accused, the prosecution submitted that the main factor is whether the accused is the owner or director of the RFA, a Registered Qualified Individual (“RQI”) or employee of the RFA, or a freelancer engaged to act as a local resident director. According to the prosecution, a freelancer should be treated as the least culpable whilst the owner or director of the RFA should be treated as the most culpable. The prosecution explained as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">i.    A freelancer who is not employed by the Registered Filing Agent but who is engaged on a freelance basis to act as a local resident director: ACRA submits that in terms of control, the freelancer has the least amount of control over whether the companies hold their AGM and file their AR, although it is his duty as a director to ensure that they do. Therefore, in terms of his role and involvement he is the least culpable among those who provide local resident director services.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">ii.    An RQI who is authorised to perform electronic transactions with ACRA, or an employee of a Registered Filing Agent (RFA) supervised by the RQI and authorised to perform electronic transactions with ACRA, or employee performing another role in the RFA: RQI(s), employees supervised by [RQIs] or employees of RFAs have a closer connection to the RFA’s clients to whom they provide local director services. Therefore, in terms of control they have more control than a freelancer and should be treated as more culpable than freelancers.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">iii.  Owner or director of RFA which provides local resident director services as part of the corporate secretarial services that they provide: Owners or directors of RFA should be treated as most culpable as they are in control of the provision of the local director services and should have systems in place to ensure compliance with the requirements to hold AGM and file AR.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As regards motive and the circumstances in which the offence was committed, the prosecution submitted that “<em>the amount and the way in which the accused was paid for providing the service of local resident director should be taken into account</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The prosecution contended that the level of culpability of the offender would, in ascending order, be as follows:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">i.    The amount and whether the director was paid a one-time fee per company: For example a director earning a small one time fee, for example, $100, for every company that he agrees to become a local resident director of, should be treated as least culpable, unless his one time fee is a very large amount, for example, $10,000 - $50,000 per company.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">ii.    The amount and whether the director was paid regularly a lump sum for all the companies he agreed to be a director of: This is because a director who is paid a lump sum irrespective of the number of companies he is a director of, is not as incentivised to take on more directorships, as a director who is paid per company.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">iii.  The amount and whether the director was paid regularly per company: This is because where a director is paid per company, his incentive to take on more directorships would be greater. And taking on more directorships would reduced [sic] his ability to supervise each company’s compliance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I find the proposed culpability framework to be unworkable. For ease of reference, I will refer to ‘freelance directors’ as directors who are neither RQIs nor employees or owners of RFAs. This is in keeping with the terminology used by the prosecution although I find that the categorisation makes little sense. First, the proposed framework is arbitrary and rigid, and may not reflect the realities of the situation. For example, I do not think it necessarily the case that a freelance director always has less control over a company’s affairs than an RQI. The prosecution has not properly articulated why this is so or explained how the control of a company’s affairs is measured. Second, as the defence rightly pointed out, culpability is an <em>offence-specific factor</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Culpability factors must directly relate to the commission of the offences in question. In my view, the quantum and manner a director is remunerated certainly has no direct bearing on how the offences in question are committed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Furthermore, parties accept the legal position that the standard of duty that is statutorily imposed on all directors is the same regardless of the labels that the directors may choose to call themselves (see <em>Abdul Ghani bin Tahir v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20397-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 125</a> at [88]; <em>PP v Tan Hang Song</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22948-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 52</a> at [32] to [34]). That being the case, it is unclear why there should be different presumptive levels of culpabilities for freelance nominee directors, RQIs or owners of RFAs. The starting point must be that insofar as nominee directors are concerned, they are to be held accountable and liable for the non-commercial statutory obligations of the companies (<em>Tan Hang Song</em> at [35]). The duties and the standards to be met are the same regardless of whether the director is a freelancer, an RQI or owner of an RFA. Save that directors who are RQIs and owners or employees of RFAs are also authorised to perform transactions with ACRA on behalf of the clients of the RFAs, I do not find any particular reason why their levels of culpability should be presumptively higher than directors who are not RQIs or owners of RFAs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The level of culpability of an offender for the offences in question would involve an inquiry into the offender’s knowledge of the obligations in question and the steps, if any, that were taken to ensure compliance with these obligations. This is not to say that the fact that a director is a freelancer, an RQI or an owner of an RFA, is irrelevant. However, as to how this has any direct bearing on the commission of the offences in question must be examined on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Turning to the present case, the prosecution submitted that the notional starting point should be uplifted on account of the accused’s culpability. According to the prosecution, the uplift is justified on the basis that the accused works for an RFA and is in the business of providing local director services, and that her “<em>motive is financial gain</em>”, seeing that she is paid S$20,000 per annum, over and above her salary as an employee of Hawksford, for providing such services.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     According to the defence, the accused is merely an employee of Hawksford and her position as a nominee director in the 241 companies arises out of her employment with Hawksford. Hawksford is in the business of providing corporate secretarial and nominee director services. It provides these services to over 1,000 foreign companies in Singapore. Typically, companies requiring nominee director services would enter into a Nominee Director Service Agreement and an Indemnity Agreement with Hawksford. As part of Hawksford’s corporate structure, certain employees would take on roles as nominee directors and the corporate secretarial department would assist these nominee directors in complying with their duties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The defence submits that the accused’s culpability is low as she had “<em>delegated for Hawksford’s corporate secretarial department to send the necessary information and reminders to the foreign officers of the Companies for their compliance</em>”. Hawksford’s corporate secretarial department had sent out numerous reminders and warnings to the foreign officers of the companies in question for, amongst other things, documents and information, in an attempt to ensure compliance with the requirements under the Act. However, its efforts had been stymied in that regard by the inaction or lack of response from the foreign officers. The defence contends that the court should not differentiate between a nominee director who personally takes steps to comply with the requirements under the Act and one who “<em>delegates the work to a corporate secretarial department</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I agree with the prosecution that an upwards adjustment to the notional starting amount should be made on account of the accused’s culpability. The accused can be said to be <em>in the business</em> of providing nominee director services. The accused is remunerated for providing nominee director services over and above the salary that she receives as an employee of Hawksford. It is true, as the defence submitted, that directors are usually paid for their services. I accept that ordinarily, the fact that a director receives remuneration for his services would have no bearing on the sentence. However, in my view, a distinction should be drawn in cases where the offender is <em>in the business</em> of providing nominee director services and who hold themselves out as having the necessary expertise and knowledge to fulfil the roles and duties of a nominee director, such as in the present case. The accused is paid to take on nominee directorships not to make executive and commercial decisions but to ensure Hawksford’s clients comply with the requirements under Singapore law and to assume the attendant duties, responsibilities and risks of a nominee director. Essentially, the accused has failed in the very duties that she has been paid precisely to carry out.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Furthermore, whilst I accept that a director may delegate the duties imposed in Sections 175 and 197 of the Act, the director still owes a duty to supervise the discharge of the delegated functions (see <em>Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd and others v Pang Seng Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 4 SLR(R) 0162.xml')">[2004] 4 SLR(R) 162</a>). Hence, the fact that Hawksford’s business structure is such that its corporate secretarial department handles all the regulatory and compliance issues does not assist the defence’s case. In the present case, apart from lending her name to various foreign companies to comply with Section 145(1) of the Act, the accused abdicated every other function of being a director. This cannot be the case since the requirement that every company has at least one locally resident director is so that that director may be held accountable for the obligations of the company (<em>Tan Hang Song</em> at [33]). If the accused were allowed to delegate every aspect of her duties and responsibilities to Hawksford’s corporate secretarial department with impunity, this will drive a coach and horses through Parliament’s intent in enacting Section 145(1) of the Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     From the above analysis, I am of the view that the notional starting point should be adjusted to a fine of S$1,300, to reflect the accused’s culpability in the matter.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Aggravating and mitigating factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I now consider the aggravating and mitigating factors raised by the parties.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a> <u>Aggravating factors</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The accused has admitted and consented to 18 charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. I accept the prosecution’s submission that this warrants an uplift in the sentence. The prosecution, however, proposes that I adopt a framework that correlates the number of charges being taken into consideration (“TIC charges”) to a precise level of uplift in the sentence, as follows:-</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     1 to 32 TIC charges: Fine would be uplifted by S$X</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     33 to 65 TIC charges: Fine would be uplifted by S$Y</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     66 to 99 TIC charges: Fine would be uplifted by S$Z</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Suffice to say, I find such an approach to be without precedent and I reject the same. This approach is also arbitrary – the prosecution has not provided any cogent explanation as to why the framework stops at 99 TIC charges or why, for example, should there be three categories. The approach is also unduly mechanistic, and it may be hackneyed for me to state that in this regard that sentencing is more an art than a science. Ultimately, I should highlight that the prosecution has the discretion in deciding the number of charges to proceed with, and the number to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. If the prosecution is of the view that the defendant is deserving of a higher fine, it could perhaps proceed with more charges rather than seek a higher fine per proceeded charge based on the numerous TIC charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Next, I regard the fact that the accused is a director of 241 companies to be a neutral factor. The prosecution contended that “<em>taking on more directorships would reduce [the director’s] ability to supervise each company’s compliance</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Intuitively, this may be true. However, there is a certain amount of presumptuousness in this submission. Ultimately, the duties that the accused owes to each company is separate. It would be unfair for the accused to be given a stiffer punishment for defaulting on her obligations for some companies on the basis that she holds directorships in numerous other companies all of which she is not in default. In the present case, the accused’s lapses concerned 10 out of the 241 companies. An argument could be made, on the contrary, that the accused should be given credit for her good track record in ensuring compliance for so many other companies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     While general deterrence would be a relevant sentencing objective, specific deterrence would have little or no role in the present case. Section 155(6) of the Act provides that a person convicted of 3 or more offences under the Act within a period of 5 years would be disqualified from holding any directorships in the 5 years following the last conviction. Following the convictions in the present case, the accused would be disqualified for a period of 5 years and must relinquish her directorships in all 241 companies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As regards the accused’s position as an employee of an RFA, I consider this to be a neutral factor for reasons as explained above. The accused committed the offences in Sections 175 and 197 because she was a nominee director of the companies in question, not because she was an employee of an RFA. Furthermore, if a director commits any wrongdoing in his capacity as an RQI or employee or owner of an RFA, this will be separately regulated under the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act (Cap. 2A) and its subsidiary legislation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a> <u>Mitigating factors</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The accused has no antecedents. She has also pleaded guilty at an early stage of the proceedings. These factors, however, would already have been accounted for in the notional starting point.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defence submits that steps had been taken to remedy or rectify the breaches in question. Such steps include rectifying the breaches and bringing some of the companies in question up to date with the holding of AGM and lodgement of the Annual Return, and also applying to strike off other companies. The defence contended that such steps “<em>should be treated akin to restitution for property-related offence which is also an accepted mitigating factor</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In my view, such steps taken to remedy or rectify the breaches carry little or no mitigating value. I disagree with the defence’s attempt to analogise the situation with restitution in a property-related offence. Restitution in a property-related offence involves returning to the victim of the crime the very property that forms the basis of the offence or compensating the victim for the value of the same. Restitution thus strives to put the victim back in the position as if the offence did not take place. This is quite different in the present case. The obligations imposed in Sections 175 and 197 of the Act require companies to hold their AGMs and lodge their Annual Return within a stipulated timeframe. A breach arises when the company fails to do so within that stipulated timeframe. I do not think such a breach can be rectified, in its true sense. The holding of an AGM or lodgement of the Annual Return after the stipulated deadline does not take away from the fact that it is done belatedly, and is still a breach of the relevant provisions. Furthermore, as the prosecution pointed out, if the company did nothing even after being notified of the breaches, it runs the risk of further breaching the same obligations for the next financial years. As regards applications to strike off a company from ACRA’s register of companies, these are usually done in cases where the foreign officers have been uncooperative. However, it begs the question as to why such steps could not be taken before the breach arises and ACRA has taken cognisance of the matter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Next, the defence submits that most of the breaches were attributable to the foreign officers’ refusal to cooperate by providing the information and documents necessary for holding an AGM or lodging the Annual Return. In some instances, no response had been forthcoming from the foreign officers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The prosecution’s position is that the court should view this mitigating factor with “<em>scepticism</em>”. First, there are a slew of measures available to local resident directors to ensure that the company complies with its obligations in Sections 175 and 197 of the Act. These measures were identified in <em>Tan Hang Song</em> and include applications to the High Court for an order that an AGM be called (Section 182 of the Act), an order compelling foreign directors to hold an AGM or at least to co-operate by providing the necessary accounting records and documents (Section 409A of the Act), an order to inspect the company’s accounting records or to compel the foreign directors to “<em>send and keep the records in Singapore and be made available for the accused’s inspection</em>” (Section 399 of the Act), and to wind up the company (Section 254(1) of the Act). Second, it is typically the case that after ACRA issues summonses to the directors in respect of the breaches, these “<em>directors were quickly / suddenly able to make contact with their clients to do the necessary, that is, to hold AGM and file AR or take instructions to strike off the company</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I accept that the lack of cooperation and non-response from the foreign officers is a mitigating factor. However, this should be viewed in conjunction with whether and how the accused took steps to get around the issue. I have doubts as to the practicality of some of the measures identified in <em>Tan Hang Song</em>. For example, applications to the High Court can be costly and even if Court orders were to be made, there may be issues with its jurisdictional reach over the foreign officers. At the minimum, in my view, applications should be made to the Registrar under Section 175 and 197 of the Act for extensions of time to comply with the provisions. Where a company is dormant or the foreign directors are uncooperative or unresponsive for some time, an application should be made to strike off the company from ACRA’s register without delay, as opposed to doing so only after ACRA issues its summonses.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In any event, I do not think the accused is entitled to rely on this mitigating factor. After all, the accused had left all manner of compliance to Hawksford’s corporate secretarial department. No doubt, she was entitled to do so given Hawksford’s business structure. However, she had even abdicated the remaining vestige of her duties as a nominee director, which was to exercise supervision over the delegated functions. She had, for all intents and purposes, no knowledge as to what was going on with the companies that she was a nominee director of and as such, no hand in any of the steps taken to ensure compliance with her duties.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the final analysis, taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors raised, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused is a fine of S$1,500 (with a default imprisonment term of 5 days) per charge. The total fine imposed is S$12,000 (with a default imprisonment term of 40 days). I consider this sentence to be in keeping with the totality principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>___________________________</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Annex A</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a
