id="p1_1"></a>1       On 4 May 2019, some four months after the accused Ashwin Kumar completed his probation and just three weeks shy of his 21<sup>st</sup> birthday, he threatened a victim with a 18cm carabiner knife and then caused hurt to a second victim in the same incident. Later on in the same month of May whilst out on bail, the accused participated in a group assault and caused hurt to a third victim. Was the accused to be treated as a youthful offender of “mostly offences committed by young boys in anger and foolishness” as his counsel said, or should deterrence be the primary sentencing consideration as prosecution submitted?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The accused pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal intimidation and two charges of causing hurt, with two other charges of possession of offensive weapons and causing hurt taken into consideration. I sentenced the accused to a total of 6 weeks imprisonment and fine of $1500, and the accused appealed my sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The criminal intimidation charge involving the carabiner knife was reduced from one of threatening death to one of threatening hurt. The accused pleaded guilty to three charges as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>DAC-919555-2020 (1<sup>st</sup> charge)</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, […] are charged that you, on the 4th day of May 2019, at about 9.30pm, at the void deck of Block 478 Pasir Ris Drive 4, Singapore, did commit criminal intimidation by carrying one carabiner knife, measuring 18 cm in length, and threatening one Sabnani Akshay Arvin with hurt, to wit, by pointing it at the said Sabnani Akshay Arvin and asking who was staring at him, with intent to cause alarm to the said Sabnani Akshay Arvin, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>MAC-907820-2020 (3<sup>rd</sup> charge)</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, […] are charged that you, on the 4th day of May 2019, at about 9.30pm, at the void deck of Block 478 Pasir Ris Drive 4, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Zarif Al Karim, to wit, by slapping the right side of the saidZarif Al Karim’s face, intending thereby to cause hurt to the said Zarif Al Karim, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>MAC-907821-2020 (4<sup>th</sup> charge)</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, […] are charged that you, on 31st day of May 2019, at or about 05.12 p.m., at road intersection of Perak Road and Dickson Road together with Navindran S/O Kumaran, and Arvindran S/O Renganathan, in furtherance of a common intention of you three, did voluntarily cause hurt to the victim, Shevam Kumar Rai, male, 20 years old, to wit, by punching and kicking the victim several times, intending thereby to cause hurt to the said Shevam Kumar Rai, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Each of the proceeded offences was punishable with an imprisonment term of up to 2 years, or with fine.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Material Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The accused was a full-time national serviceman at the time of the offences. The offences in the 1st and 3<sup>rd</sup> charges against the first two victims were committed in the same incident. The offence in the 4<sup>th</sup> charge was committed in a subsequent incident against a third victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The material facts extracted from the Statement of Facts admitted without qualification by the accused are set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">Facts relating to the 1<sup>st</sup> charge </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The informant who was also the victim in the 1<sup>st</sup> charge was Sabnani Akshay Arvin, male Indian, aged 25 years old, Singapore Citizen and a student. On 4 May 2019 at about 9.30pm, the informant and his friends were chatting at the void deck of Block 478 Pasir Ris Drive 4, Singapore. Shortly after, they heard a commotion between the accused and his friends at the adjacent block, about 10 metres away. The informant then called the police while his friends kept their eyes on the accused and his friends.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The accused noticed that the informant and his friends were looking in his direction. He approached the informant and his friends in an aggressive manner and confronted them for staring at him. During the confrontation, the accused took out a carabiner knife, measuring 18cm in length and pointed it at the informant, asking who had stared at him. The accused also challenged the informant and his friends to a fight. The informant was alarmed by the accused’s action. He raised both his palms and told the accused that no one was staring at him. The accused then walked away and threw his carabiner knife in the dustbin. A photo of the carabiner knife was set out in the statement of facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       By virtue of the foregoing, the accused committed the offence of criminal intimidation punishable under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">Facts relating to 3<sup>rd</sup> charge </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The victim in the 3<sup>rd</sup> charge was Zarif AI Karim, male Bangladeshi, aged 19 years old, and a student. In the same incident, the victim had started staring at the accused and his friends who were behaving rowdily at the adjacent block as he was curious about what they were doing. The accused had confronted the victim and his friends, and challenged the victim and his friends to a fight as referred to in the 1<sup>st</sup> charge. The accused then slapped the right side of the victim’s face once with the intention to cause hurt to the victim. The victim felt pain on his face. This occurred prior to the accused throwing away the carabiner knife as referred to in the 1<sup>st</sup> charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">Facts relating to the 4<sup>th</sup> charge </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The complainant who was also the victim in the 4<sup>th</sup> charge was Shevam Kumar Rai S/O R K Rai, male Indian, aged 20 years old, Singapore Citizen, and a student.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The first and second witnesses were the friends of the accused. The first witness was Arvindran S/O Renganathan, male, aged 20 years old, Indian, Singapore Citizen and a student. The second witness was Navindran S/O Kumaran, male, aged 20 years old, Indian, Singapore Citizen, and also a student.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The third witness Praveen s/o Manimaran, male, aged 18 years old was the complainant’s friend.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 31 May 2019 at about 5.30pm, the accused, the first witness and the second witness had a dispute with the third witness, the complainant’s friend, at the road intersection of Perak Road and Dickson Road. The complainant intervened in an attempt to stop the dispute. As a result, the accused, the first witness and the second witness, in furtherance of a common intention of the three of them, punched and kicked the complainant several times, with the intention of causing hurt to the complainant. This caused pain to the complainant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused committed an offence of voluntarily causing hurt with common intention punishable under Section 323 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charges taken into consideration</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The accused admitted and consented to two further charges to be taken into consideration in sentencing. The first TIC charge ( the 2<sup>nd</sup> charge) was for unlawful possession of the carabiner knife used in the criminal intimidation charge on 4 May 2019, and the second TIC charge ( the 5<sup>th</sup> charge ) was for causing hurt with the co-accused persons by punching and kicking the third witness in the 31<sup>st</sup> May 2019 incident.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s submissions for 8 weeks’ imprisonment and fine</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment comprising four weeks’ jail for the criminal intimidation charge, fine for the slapping incident in the 3<sup>rd</sup> charge, and four weeks’ imprisonment for the group assault in the 4<sup>th</sup> charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The accused was not recommended for probation and a Community Service Order (“CSO), but was found suitable for a Day Reporting Order(“DRO”). Prosecution objected to community based sentences. Specific deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration and not rehabilitation. The accused had committed the series of offences four months after completing his probation, and the second set of offences in the later part of May 2019 had been committed while the accused was on bail.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence submissions for community based sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Counsel submitted that the accused should continue to be treated as a youthful offender and be sentenced to a DRO and a short detention order (“SDO”) for deterrence if necessary. The accused was a young and angry man, but had remained crime-free since the offences in May 2019, was progressing well in his employment and his rehabilitative trajectory was positive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Alternatively, the accused should be sentenced to a global sentence of five weeks’ jail and fine – four weeks’ jail for the criminal intimidation offence, a fine of $1000 for the slapping incident, and one week’s jail and fine for the group assault.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relevant legal principles when sentencing offenders at the cusp of the age of majority </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The accused committed the first set of offences comprised in May 2019 three weeks before his 21<sup>st</sup> birthday, and the second set of offences in the same month a few days after his 21<sup>st</sup> birthday. His case first came before the mentions court in September 2020, and when he first came before me in November 2020 for his plea to be taken he was about 22 years 5 months old.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The High Court in <em>A Karthik v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a> <em>(“Karthik”</em>) stated that as regards offenders like the accused who were less than 21 years old at the time of offending but above 21 years old at the time of sentencing, the retrospective rationale underpinning the sentencing of young offenders continued to be relevant. The retrospective rationale seeks to justify giving a young offender a second chance by excusing his actions on the grounds of his youthful folly and experience, and rests on the offender’s age at the time of the offence: at [37].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As the accused was above 21 years old at the time of sentencing, the prospective rationale, which justifies rehabilitation as the preferred tool to discourage future offending by young offenders, would not apply as strongly, if at all: at [45]. A more nuanced approach should be taken in assessing the relevance of the prospective rationale.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The court in <em>Karthik</em> guided that the proper approach in assessing the relevance of the prospective rationale to such an offender was to examine all the facts of the case- including the offender’s age at each of the two material points in time, the length of the delay between two points of time, and the available evidence of the trajectory of the offender’s rehabilitative progress in the intervening period- and determine whether it is appropriate to treat the offender as a youthful offender such that the presumption that rehabilitation is the key sentencing consideration continues to apply: at [58].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The issues for determination by the court were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     Is the accused to be treated as a youthful offender?</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     Should the accused be sentenced to community based sentences?</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     What is the appropriate sentence to be imposed?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Should the accused to be treated as a youthful offender?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Retrospective rationale continues to apply to the accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As the accused was on the fringes of his 21<sup>st</sup> birthday when the two sets of offences were committed, the retrospective rationale underpinning the sentencing of young offenders continued to be relevant. The High Court in <em>PP v Abdul Qayyum bin Abdul Razak</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24257-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 57</a> (“<em>Abdul Qayyum</em>”) had guided that <em>Ho Mei Xia Hannah v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24000-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 978</a> (“<em>Hannah Ho</em>”) did not stand for a proposition that the retrospective rationale applies with little force to an offender who is at the cusp of turning 21 years old at the time of the offence: at [10].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     If the accused was to be treated as a youthful offender despite being more than 21 years old at the time of sentencing, both the retrospective and prospective rationale underpinning the sentencing of young offenders would apply and rehabilitation is presumed to be the dominant sentencing consideration.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Counsel’s submission that the accused to be treated as a youthful offender like the accused in Abdul Qayyum</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Counsel submitted that the accused was in a similar position to the accused in <em>Abdul Qayyum</em>, who was sentenced to community sentences despite having been previously placed on probation, and he should also be treated as a youthful offender like the accused in <em>Abdul Qayyum</em>. The accused had shown a positive trajectory, having remained crime-free since the offences in May 2019 and he had been gainfully employed and received a “glowing testimonial” from his employer. Although he did not have a young family like the accused in <em>Abdul Qayyum</em> that should not be held against him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The accused in Abdul Qayyum was 20 years old at the time of the offences and 21 years old at the time of sentencing, and faced one charge of unlawful assembly under section 143 of the Penal Code. He had been previously sentenced to probation for a similar offence of unlawful assembly. His sentence of one month’s jail was substituted with a combination of community based sentences comprising DRO, CSO and 7 days SDO. The High Court was of the view that the accused should continue to be treated as a youthful offender – he was found suitable for a DRO, he had remained crime-free since the commission of the offences 21 months ago, he had kept regular employment and endeavored to improve his employment status, he had a young family with a supportive wife which provided him with the strongest possible reason to want to reform, and he had secured a rental flat to provide a stable home or his family.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the present case the pre-sentence reports stated that the accused was not recommended for probation and CSO, but suitable for a five-month DRO with electronic monitoring and referral to agency to address his anger management. The reports were prepared by different officers. The DRO report was prepared by the correctional rehabilitation specialist, while the probation and CSO reports were prepared by the probation officer\community service officer. The DRO report had assessed the accused to be at moderate risk of criminal offending and also noted his main risk factors such as thinking supportive of crime, association with anti-social peers, alcohol consumption, and his limited coping and anger management skills. Similar risk factors had been noted and elaborated on in the more comprehensive probation report.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused not to be treated as a youthful offender for sentencing purposes</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In assessing whether the accused was to be considered a youthful offender, I considered the factors as guided by the courts in <em>Karthik</em> and <em>Abdul Qayyum.</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In favour of the accused was that he was found suitable for DRO subject to electronic monitoring, that he had remained crime-free for some 23 months since committing the offences in May 2019, and he had sought to be constructively engaged in employment since completing his national service around October 2019. His positive attitude towards employment was noted to be a protective factor in both the probation and DRO reports.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Not a particularly youthful offender</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The accused was not a particularly young offender at the time of the commission of the offences, having committed both sets of offences in the same month he turned 21 years old. In comparison, the accused in <em>Abdul Qayyum</em> committed his offences when he was 20 years old and was 21 years old at the time of sentencing, while the accused in <em>Karthik</em> committed his offences when he was 17 years old and was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. In this case, the accused had been enlisted in national service since Oct 2017 and was already serving national service for more than one and a half years at the time he committed the series of offences in May 2019, and was holding the vocation of close combat instructor at that time.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lack of positive trajectory in his rehabilitative progress </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As regards the available evidence of the trajectory of the accused’s rehabilitative progress in the 23-months between the offences and the time of sentencing, I was not persuaded that the accused had indeed shown a positive trajectory of rehabilitative progress.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Of concern was the accused’s continued marginalization of his role in the offences and externalization of blame to the victims, which was noted in both the probation report and the DRO report. He had maintained to the probation officer that as regards the threat with the carabiner knife, he had acted in self-defence, and said he had slapped the second victim out of anger because he presumed they were teasing him. As regard the group attack, he disputed the statement of facts and said that he was the one who had attempted to stop the fight but was assaulted, and that he acted in self-defence. The DRO report assessed that the accused displayed thinking supportive of crime based on the account he gave of the 2019 offences. The accused minimized his offence and gave accounts that were inconsistent with various aspects of the agreed statement of facts. For example, he claimed that he had pointed the knife away from the victim and that he was acting in self-defence: at [13] of the DRO report. In fact the DRO report had also noted that the accused had continued to rationalize his participation in the 2017 unlawful assembly offences as well, that he had merely tagged along to prevent his friend from getting into trouble.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     While the accused had sought to be constructively engaged in employment, there was a lack of evidence that he was in any sort of stable employment for any substantial length of time after he completed his national service.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Although the accused did receive a positive testimonial from a part-time employer but counsel was overstating the value of the “glowing testimonial”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The court in <em>PP v Chua Wen Hao</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25791-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGHC 70</a> had declined to place any weight on a testimonial about the accused’s exceptional performance and good character, written by a superior who had only worked with the accused for eight months and only after his arrest. In the present case, the superior who provided the testimonial had worked with the accused for only four months. The accused was a Yard Assistant at Armada Rig Builders working on a part-time basis since August 2020, and the testimonial was written by his operations manager some four months later in December 2020. The operations manager would have known the accused a short time and based only on the accused’s part-time work contributions. The testimonial could only carry limited weight. It would also seem that by April 2021, the accused had changed employment as he had informed the court during the breach of trial curfew hearing that he was a car wash supervisor.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">No plausible account for his breach of trial curfew</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The probation report had noted the accused’s breach of the trial curfew on 25<sup>th</sup> March 21. This was initially denied by the accused. After the probation report was issued counsel in his written submissions said that he had taken the accused’s instructions. The accused was at home and in “full compliance of the curfew conditions”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As the accused continued to maintain his denial of breach when the case was mentioned in court, I conducted a hearing to determine the issue and heard testimony from the probation officer Mr Lopez and the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The undisputed evidence was that the accused had been informed about of a trial curfew from 11pm to 6am with effect from 3 Feb 21. The accused was not to leave the house during those hours except for medical reasons. Mr Lopez also specifically told the accused the curfew required the accused to have “both feet inside the home” and not be in the corridor outside his home.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Mr Lopez checked on the accused on 5 March 21 and the accused was compliant. On 25 March 21 at 1114pm, Mr Lopez called the accused on his mobile phone and the accused told him he was at home. Mr Lopez told the accused he would be calling him again using the video call mode, and then called three times from 1114pm to 1116pm. There was no reply from the accused. He then called the accused’s mother who went to check and she told him the accused was not at home. At 1120pm the accused sent him a text message saying he was at home. Mr Lopez texted back to say his mother confirmed he was not at home. At 1132pm the accused sent a live location stating he was at home. The accused variously told Mr Lopez that outside his house no wifi, that he had not paid his bills and his line was cut. It was not disputed that the accused had tried calling Mr Lopez but Mr Lopez did not wish to engage him at that hour as he did not want to get into an argument.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The accused did not dispute knowing that the curfew required him to be inside his home. He claimed that he was standing outside his house when Mr Lopez called. He was having a rough patch with his girlfriend and having arguments. Because he did not want his family to hear, the only place he could talk to her was outside the house. He said he was 2-3m away from the door when Mr Lopez first called, and but then he went nearer the rubbish chute area and lost wifi.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Post-hearing in view of what the accused had told the court, counsel changed tack and retracted the denial of breach, but said that the accused had provided a plausible explanation for his breach.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The accused was plainly in breach of the trial curfew, and he had also failed to provide any valid or plausible account for the breach. Preferring or needing to speak to his girlfriend outside the house during curfew hours was not a valid reason for breaching the curfew. In fact the accused had lied to Mr Lopez in the first call when he claimed to be at home, despite being fully aware that he was required to have both legs inside his house. In addition, his purported explanation for not picking up the calls as he had moved closer to the rubbish bin area and lost the wifi made little sense. After being made aware that Mr Lopez was going to call him it was not plausible why he would move further away towards the rubbish bin area where the wifi would be weaker or lost. In any event the accused had no difficulty taking calls outside his house from his girlfriend nor from Mr Lopez despite his conflicting explanations about his line being cut off and losing wifi.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The probation report noted that the failure to comply with the trial curfew and unwillingness to accept responsibility reflected defiance and dishonesty towards supervision measures and was one of the list of ten risk factors noted about the accused on pages 1 and 2 of the probation report.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In my view the accused did not take the trial curfew conditions seriously. He was more preoccupied with his need to be outside his house during curfew hours for his own reasons, despite being fully aware that he needed to have both feet inside his house during curfew hours. He had also lied to his probation officer about being at home. Neither had he accepted responsibility for the breach – not only had he initially disputed the breach, he had also provided an implausible account for the breach.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Having considered all the circumstances, this case bore little similarity to that of the accused person in <em>Abdul Qayyum</em> and did not merit treating the accused as a youthful offender for the purposes of sentencing, where rehabilitation would be the presumptive dominant sentencing consideration. It could not be said that the accused had shown a positive trajectory in the 23-months since the commission of the offences. Rather he had exhibited a lack of remorse by minimizing, justifying and externalizing his offences, and derogating from the role he played as set out in the statement of facts. His substantial list of ten risk factors noted in the probation report far outweighed his protective factors, and the DRO report had similarly noted his main risk factors of thinking supportive of crime, association with anti-social peers and alcohol consumption. He had also not complied with the trial curfew, displaying a lack of respect for and compliance with rules.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Should the accused be sentenced to community based sentences? </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Community based sentences and adult offenders</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Even though the accused would not be treated as a youthful offender for sentencing purposes such that rehabilitation is presumed to be the dominant sentencing consideration, adult offenders are not <em>ipso facto</em> denied the opportunity to be considered for community-based sentences (“CBS”): <em>Sim Wen Yi Earnest v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19333-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 174</a> (“<em>Earnest Sim</em>”) at [40] and[42]. Rehabilitative considerations do not automatically recede into the background in the case of adult offenders and even if probation was not suitable for that offender, a rehabilitative approach should not be wholly disregarded and a CBS sentence may still be considered in appropriate cases: <em>Abdul Qayyum.</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the court to be on the rehabilitative end of the spectrum such as regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions, where it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community: <em>GCX v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23269-SSP.xml')">[2019] 3 SLR 1325</a> (“<em>GCX</em>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Although the primary focus of CBS is rehabilitative, CBS are punitive and the avoidance of moral stigmatisation is not the primary objective. SDOs are not premised purely on rehabilitative considerations, and general deterrence does not always dictate that an imprisonment term must be imposed. In appropriate cases SDOs may adequately address the need for deterrence: <em>Earnest Sim</em> at [12], [13] and [15] and <em>Abdul Qayyum</em> at [14].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Determining the dominant sentencing consideration </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The court in <em>Karthik</em> observed that rehabilitation would typically not be the operative concern in the case of adult offenders unless the particular offender demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform or there exists other exceptional circumstances: at [44]. In <em>Teo Chang Heng</em>, the court in imposing a SDO for a 44 year old offender considered the facts as unusual and possibly quite exceptional and that the offender had acted out of character, and it was unlikely he would re-offend again: at [14] and [18]. Likewise in <em>Earnest Sim</em>, the court in sentencing the 25 year old offender to CBS was of the view even though the accused had committed multiple offences, he was unlikely to re-offend.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As guided by the court in <em>Earnest Sim</em>, the circumstances of both the offence and the offender should be scrutinised to determine the key sentencing consideration that should apply. I therefore turned to assess the dominant sentencing consideration in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Displayed propensity towards violence despite having completed probation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Although the maximum sentences prescribed for the offences did not suggest that the offences were so serious nor had serious harm been caused to the victims such that deterrence and retribution would outright trump all other considerations, the accused had displayed a disturbing propensity towards the use of violence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The criminal intimidation charge involved the use of a cutting-weapon with a substantial blade, as seen from the photograph of the carabiner contained in the statement of facts, and it was a weapon capable of causing substantial injury. Not only was the accused in unlawful possession of the carabiner knife at that time ( which was the subject of the 2<sup>nd</sup> TIC charge under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act carrying a sentence of three years jail and punishable with caning of not less than 6 strokes ), the ease with which he resorted to using the carabiner knife was concerning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It had taken little to trigger the accused’s display of overt aggression towards the two victims in the 4 May 2019 incident, and his actions showed his propensity to resort to violent means at the slightest. He was the aggressor armed with the carabiner knife who approached the victims who were seated in the next block. They had been chatting and looked across when they heard a commotion between the accused and his friends. Not only the accused point the carabiner at the first victim, he had then challenged them to a fight. Not done with intimidating the first victim with the carabiner knife and challenging them to a fight, he then proceeded to slap the 2<sup>nd</sup> victim who had given him no provocation during the confrontation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     This 4 May 2019 incident involved an escalation in the use of violence by the accused, despite completing his probation just some four months earlier. In the 2017 incident for which he was sentenced to eighteen months supervised probation, he had been among a group of eight members of an unlawful assembly. Two of these members had been armed with a chopper and a knife. The accused had been aware that there would be a settlement talk and he had witnessed the victims being confronted with the weapons, but he himself did not himself participate in hurting or threatening the victims.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The accused had also exhibited recalcitrance despite the probation. In the second set of offences committed only a few weeks later, these offences were committed while he was out on bail and under investigation for the 4 May 2019 offences. In this incident, the accused and his two friends had punched and kicked both victims several times. There was no suggestion that the victim was being provocative. According to the statement of facts the victim was attempting to stop a dispute between the accused’s group and the victim’s friend when he was attacked.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Considerations of retribution were also relevant. Although none of the victims had suffered serious physical injury, the accused’s offences in the five proceeded and TIC charges had involved four different victims.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The accused’s propensity for reform was also doubtful when all the circumstances were considered. Remaining crime-free for 23 months could mean that the accused had made real rehabilitative progress, or it could simply be the overhang of the pending criminal proceedings that was keeping him in check, or both. Previously the accused had also remained crime-free for about 22 months before re-offending. As he had re-offended soon after his probation was completed, this suggested that he had not been successfully rehabilitated, or that he had quickly forgotten what he had been taught, or recalcitrance, or that the consequences of a breach of the probation order had kept him in check, or a combination of the foregoing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I had noted the accused’s lack of positive rehabilitative trajectory earlier: at [34],[35],[45] to [48]. Some twenty months after the offences in May 2019, he still externalising blame to his victims and minimising his role, despite having pleaded guilty to the offences. He continued to display a lack of regard for rules or authority by breaching trial curfew.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The DRO report had noted that the accused was at moderate risk of criminal re-offending based on his Level of Service\Case Management Inventory (LS\CMI) score, and that he had displayed thinking supportive of crime despite the probation. In imposing CBS, the courts in both <em>Teo Chang Hong</em> and <em>Earnest Sim</em> were of the view that the offenders were unlikely to re-offend. In this case it could not be said that the accused was unlikely to reoffend or that he had acted out of character in committing the series offences. The facts did not suggest that the accused’s capacity for rehabilitation was so promising that community sentences should be imposed or that a SDO was of sufficient deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Having considered all the circumstances of both the offence and the offender, the dominant sentencing consideration was deterrence, in particular specific deterrence, and not rehabilitation. This was not a case to be considered at the rehabilitative end of the spectrum. Rehabilitative considerations were eclipsed by deterrence given the accused’s propensity for violence, lack of remorse and his substantial risk factors, which were compounded by both the offence and offender-specific aggravating factors, which called for a substantial jail term to be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: What is the appropriate sentence to be imposed? </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties’ positions on sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The parties were agreed on the sentences for the 1<sup>st</sup> charge and the 3<sup>rd</sup> charge, but differed on the sentence for the 4<sup>th</sup> charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Prosecution sought a global jail term of eight weeks and fine: four weeks jail for the 1<sup>st</sup> charge, a fine for the 3<sup>rd</sup> charge and four weeks jail for the 4<sup>th</sup> charge, with the sentences in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> charge to run consecutively. In their alternative sentencing submission, Defence agreed with the submissions for four weeks jail for the 1<sup>st</sup> charge and submitted for a fine of $1000 for the 3<sup>rd</sup> charge. For the 4<sup>th</sup> charge, counsel said that one week’s jail and fine was appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s sentencing table for the criminal intimidation charge </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Prosecution’s sentencing table of four cases showed that the accused persons had been sentenced to jail terms of between five weeks to two months. The table comprised three unreported State Courts cases where the accused persons had pleaded guilty and a High Court decision where the accused had claimed trial: <em>PP v Samsudin bin Ithnin</em> (SC-913360-2014) (“<em>Samsudin</em>”), <em>PP v Arumugam Anandhasejian</em> (SC-900009-2019) (“<em>Arumugam</em>”), <em>Ong Sock Hung v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/47354-M.xml')">[2005] SGHC 95</a> (“<em>Ong Sock Hung</em>”) and <em>PP v Ho Koon Hong Roland</em> (SC-906307-2017) (“<em>Roland Hong</em>”). I will deal with these cases in the order as they were set out in the table.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In <em>Samsudin</em>, the accused became angry with the victim when she went to sleep instead of having sex with him as promised. He went to the kitchen and took a kitchen knife with a 20cm blade and pointed it at her and asked her why she went to sleep after promising him sex. He was sentenced to six weeks’ jail with a second section 506 charge taken into consideration.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In <em>Arumugam</em>, the accused and his friend had a dispute with some Bangladeshi workers. He returned to his dorm and took a knife with a 12-cm blade and a chopper with a 16-cm blade. He kept the knife and passed the chopper to his friend, and returned to confront the Bangladeshi workers. The accused pointed the knife at the victim. He was sentenced to five weeks’ jail, with 2 other charges for being armed with an offensive weapon and fisting the same victim taken into consideration.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As for <em>Ong Sock Hung</em> where the accused had claimed trial, the accused and the victim were neighbours in an acrimonious relationship. The accused brandished a chopper outside the victim’s flat, made a hacking motion and said “I will kill your whole family”. The accused was sentenced to two months’ jail. In <em>Roland Hong</em>, the accused and victim were also neighbours in an acrimonious relationship. When the victim returned home, the accused was standing at the gate of his own flat holding a chopper with a 18cm blade and hurled vulgarities at her. He then walked to the gate of the victim’s flat and pointed the chopper at her in a threatening manner, tried to pull open the gate and struck the gate with the chopper. The accused was sentenced to two months’ jail.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The factual matrices of the four cases were very different from the present case, containing their own offence and offender-specific aggravating factors that did not feature in the present case. In <em>Samsudin’s</em> case there was premeditation involved as the accused had gone into the kitchen to retrieve the knife before returning to threaten the victim, and the weapon involved a substantially longer blade of 20 cm. Likewise the offence in <em>Arumugam</em> involved premeditation as the accused had returned to the dorm to retrieve weapons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     As for <em>Ong Sock Hung</em> and <em>Roland Hong</em>, the offences involved the use of choppers, accompanied by threats to kill and\or harm uttered to the victims outside their own homes, and the choppers had been brandished in a menacing way. The accused in <em>Ong Sock Hung</em> had waved the chopper in a hacking motion, while the accused in <em>Roland Hong</em> had used it to strike at the victim’s gate besides pointing it at the victim. Both cases involved parties who were neighbours and considerations of specific deterrence would feature in sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Unlike the cases cited in the table, there was no premeditation involved in the use of the carabiner knife in the confrontation. Similar to the accused, in <em>Arumugam</em> the accused here was the aggressor confronting a group of persons he was unhappy with. However I did not consider the accused’s culpability to be as high as that of the accused in <em>Arumugam’s</em> case who was sentenced to five weeks’ jail. The accused in <em>Arumugam</em> not only acted with premeditation in returning to the dorm to arm himself, he had passed a chopper to his co-accused. During the confrontation he had followed another Bangladeshi worker who had tried to stop the accused, before returning to confront the victim. The confrontation had also involved two accused persons who were armed, and the accused also had two TIC charges taken into consideration, which included one for fisting the same victim on his face.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In this case I took account that the accused was the aggressor. He not only pointed the knife at the victim but had challenged the victim and his friends to a fight whilst holding the carabiner knife, and had only thrown away the knife after he had slapped the second victim. The accused also had a TIC charge for unlawful possession of the carabiner knife. Against this I considered that the accused had pleaded guilty and saved the court’s time and resources, co-operated with the authorities, and was at the fringes of turning 21 years old when the offence was committed. In my view a sentence of 3 weeks’ jail would be appropriate and imposed it accordingly</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Low Song Chye sentencing framework for section 323 offences (3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> charges)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The High Court in <em>Low Song Chye</em> prescribed three broad sentencing bands with indicative sentencing ranges based on the level of hurt caused in the offence for first-time offenders who pleaded guilty: at [77] and [78]. The court is to undertake a two-step inquiry:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, to derive the appropriate indicative starting point, the court is to identify the applicable sentencing band and where the offence falls within the indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused, having regard to the relative severity of the hurt sustained compared to the other forms of hurt within that sentencing band and the relevant sentencing precedents: [80], [83] and [88].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the court is to make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors, including the aggravating and mitigating factors identified in <em>PP v BDB</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> (“<em>BDB</em>”), which may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The three sentencing bands in <em>Low Song Chye</em> are set out below:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="16.2232446489298%"/> <col width="48.6697339467894%"/> <col width="35.1070214042809%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Band</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Hurt caused</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Indicative sentencing range</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to four weeks</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing precedents submitted for the 4<sup>th</sup> charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In support of its sentence of four weeks jail for the 4<sup>th</sup> charge, prosecution tendered two sentencing tables. The first was a table of three 2017\2018 <em>pre-Low Seng Chye</em> reported State Court plead-guilty cases that had gone on appeal. Prosecution submitted that the cases showed that custodial sentences of one month have been imposed even in cases where the victims suffered minor injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The first case <em>Yong Chee Meng</em> involved an assault by the accused and co-accused punching and kicking a victim who had scolded them for smoking inside a lift. The sentence of one month’s jail was affirmed on appeal. The second case <em>Chan Siew Yin</em> involved a passenger who punched a taxi-driver on his face, and the sentence of 4 weeks’ jail was affirmed on appeal. In the third case <em>Lee Beng Yong</em>, the accused went into a school classroom and slapped the 9 year-old victim who had allegedly bullied his daughter. The fine sentence was increased to 2 weeks’ jail on appeal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The appropriate sentence to be imposed in a causing hurt offence is a fact-specific exercise. The only fact similarity was that the first case <em>Yong Chee Meng</em> also involved an assault by two accused persons who had kicked and punched the victim. That aside the three cases cited involved dissimilar factual matrices and were of limited assistance to prosecution. Notably the victims in all three cases cited had suffered more, although minor, injury compared to the two victims in the present case (soft tissue injury in <em>Yong Chee Meng</em>, bleeding laceration and bruising on the face with 3-days medical leave in <em>Chan Siew Ying</em>, and facial pain, linear erythematous patches and mild odema at jawline in <em>Lee Beng Yong</em>). Moreover each of the three cases had its own peculiar aggravating factors (assault inside a lift in <em>Yong Chee Meng</em>, assault on public transport worker in <em>Chan Siew Yin</em>, and assault on vulnerable victim in <em>Lee Beng Yong</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Prosecution subsequently submitted a second table of <em>post-Low Seng Chye</em> cases, comprising five unreported plead-guilty cases<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. These cases showed that the courts have imposed a jail sentence of up to three weeks’ jail, even when there were no medical reports of injuries suffered or injuries were minor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Prosecution submitted only on <em>Paneer</em>, the second case in the table, where the accused had head-butted the victim’s chin causing him pain. The accused was sentenced to two week’s jail. Prosecution said that an uplift of two weeks jail was not inappropriate given the aggravating features in the 4<sup>th</sup> charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The facts and circumstances of the hurt offences in the second table were diverse (victim was hit on the head with a stick in <em>Amzah</em>, victim was punched on the face in her mouth in <em>Chong</em>, <em>Suthan’s</em> case involved domestic violence where the accused had pushed the victim against a wall and pushed the victim’s neck with his forearm).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     On a broad level, the cases showed that post-<em>Low Song Chye</em> the courts have imposed custodial sentences in appropriate cases, even when the victims did not seek medical attention or suffered only pain (Band 1 injuries). However each case turned upon its own facts and being unreported decisions, they were of limited precedent value as the factors that had weighed with the court were unknown. Moreover the accused persons in all five cases in the second table had multiple TIC charges and it is unknown how that had weighed in the sentence for each case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I will elaborate only on the facts of <em>Paneer</em> which was referred to by prosecution. In <em>Paneer</em> the accused was involved in two separate causing hurt incidents. He faced two section 323 charge and one section 336(a) rash act charge, and he had another five TIC charges arising from the same two incidents involving the same two victims in the proceeded charges and a third victim. In the first section 323 incident, the accused was riding his motorcycle and had a dispute with the victim at a zebra crossing. He pushed the victim in his chest and the victim fell. He then rode his motorcycle in a threatening manner towards the victim, and this was the subject of the rash act charge. While under investigation for this incident, the accused committed the second hurt charge. He had a dispute with a resident of a condominium and his wife where he worked as security guard. He then headbutted the victim on the chin causing him pain.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The accused was traced for dated antecedents in 1993 and 1994 for Criminal Law Temporary Provisions Act supervision and breach, and unlawful assembly in 1994. Both victims had only suffered pain. He was sentenced to custodial terms for both hurt charges – five days’ jail and two week’s jail respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In support of Defence’s contention that the 4<sup>th</sup> charge merited a week’s jail and fine, counsel cited a 2017 newspaper extract of an accused <em>Seah Hock Teck</em> aged 54 years old who was sentenced to a week’s jail and a $2000 fine. Counsel initially submitted argued that the accused Seah had picked up a chair and used it on the victim and his offence was therefore more serious. However counsel later conceded that the report did not state that that Seah had actually used the chair.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     This case could be of little assistance to Defence. Being an unreported decision it was of little precedent value, and the newspaper extract was also scant on Seah’s role. The newspaper extract said that Seah and a friend had “joined in” when a third friend was exchanging punches with the victim, and he had picked up a chair and marched towards them. However nothing was reported as to what Seah actually did or that he had used the chair other than picking it up. Instead it was reported that he was hit on the head an fell down and required 4 stitches.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applying the Low Seng Chye sentencing framework to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> charges </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The victims in both the 3rd and 4th charges did not seek medical attention, and the statement of facts reflected that they had only suffered pain. This would put the harm caused at the lower end of Band 1 in the <em>Low Seng Chye</em> framework. I then turned to assess the accused’s culpability, and the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mitigating factors raised by counsel</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In sentencing, the relevant mitigation factors were the accused’s timely plea of guilt which had saved the court’s time and resources, and that he had co-operated in police investigations. However the <em>Low Seng Chye</em> framework applied to offenders who plead guilty and the guilty plea <em>per se</em> would not merit further adjustment of the sentences. I also considered that both sets of offences had been committed in the month he turned 21 years old. That the four victims did not suffer serious injury was not a mitigating factor, but had been taken into account in calibrating the appropriate sentence in the <em>Low Seng Chye</em> framework. As regards the claim that the accused was deeply remorseful and had taken full responsibility for his actions, I gave this little mitigating weight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     As the court in <em>Chen Weixiong Jerrick</em> v PP [2003]2 SLR (R) 334 had observed, whilst pleas for leniency may glibly state that an accused is remorseful when the strong arm of the law has caught up with an accused, remorse is considered a mitigating factor only where there is evidence of genuine compunction or remorse on the part of the offender. Apologetic gestures must be carefully scrutinized to see whether they constitute evidence of genuine heartfelt remorse: [22] and [23]. In this case Counsel did not surface any particular apologetic gestures on the part of the accused. On the contrary, the accused’s attitude towards his offences and victims derogated from genuine remorse.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Slapping the victim in the 3<sup>rd</sup> charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I had dealt with the circumstances of the commission of this offence earlier. There were offence-specific factors that increased the accused’s culpability. He was the aggressor and had slapped the victim who had given no provocation whatsoever during the confrontation, and whilst being in possession of the carabiner knife. In my view the accused’s culpability bordered in the medium range. Balancing this against the applicable mitigating factors, a slightly higher fine that the usual $1000 fine tariff should be imposed to reflect the aggravating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Kicking and punching the victim with co-accused persons in the 4<sup>th</sup> charge </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     There were multiple offence and offender-specific factors that enhanced the accused’s culpability to the high range for this offence. As regards the circumstances of the commission of the offence, this was a group assault and the accused had participated by kicking and punching the victim several times. The victim had not given any provocation except to try and stop the dispute between the accused’s group and his friend, and the accused and his friends outnumbered the victim. As for offender-specific factors, the offence was committed by the accused whilst he was on bail and under investigation for the 4 May 2019 offences which showed his disregard for the law and his recalcitrance. There was also another TIC charge of causing hurt to the victim’s friend. These factors would lift the sentence to the high end of the Band 1 sentencing range. Even after the applicable mitigating actors were weighed in, the custodial threshold would have been substantially crossed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     As for parity, prosecution informed that the two co-accused were young offenders who faced other charges, and they were sentenced to probation and given a conditional warning respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     As for the length of the custodial sentence, I considered the accused’s offence to be more egregious than that of the accused in <em>Paneer</em> who was sentenced to two weeks’ jail for committing the second hurt offence of headbutting the victim’s chin when he was out on bail. An uplift from the two weeks’ jail that <em>Paneer</em> received would be warranted, given the level of violence involved in the assault in the present case and that it also involved multiple assailants. However I was of the view the offence was less egregious than the assault in <em>Yong Chee Meng</em> where the victim had been attacked from the back in the confined space of a lift and the assailants had then kicked and punched the victim for minute, resulting in the victim suffering soft tissue injury. In the circumstances I was of the view that a one week uplift from the two-week jail sentence in <em>Paneer’s</em> case would be proportionate and adequately address specific deterrence and the gravity of the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     All things considered I was of the view that the appropriate sentences were three weeks’ imprisonment for the 1<sup>st</sup> charge, a fine of $1500 in default one week’ imprisonment for the 3<sup>rd</sup> charge, and three weeks’ imprisonment for the 4<sup>th</sup> charge. The offences in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> charges were committed in separate incidents, and involved different victims and distinct legally protected interests. I ordered the two imprisonment terms to run consecutively, which would appropriately reflect the overall criminality of the accused in the proceeded charges and were sufficient to address the need for deterrence. I satisfied myself that the global sentence of six weeks’ jail and fine of $1500 including the default term for the three offences did not infringe the totality principle. I sentenced the accused accordingly.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup><em>PP v Yong Chee Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20437-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGMC 36</a> (“<em>Yong Chee Meng</em>”), <em>PP v Chan Siew Yin</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21805-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGMC 27</a> (“<em>Chan Siew Yin</em>”) and <em>PP v Lee Beng Yong @Muhammad Zaki Lee</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20087-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGMC 12</a> (“Lee Beng Yong”), respectively serial number 1, 2 and 3 in the table</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup><em>PP v Amzah B Jalil</em> (MAC 903938-20) (“<em>Amzah</em>”), <em>PP v Paneer Selvam s\o Perumal</em> (MAC 901157-20 &amp; others) <em>(“Paneer”)</em>, <em>PP v Chong Khim Kok</em> (MAC 902795-20) (“<em>Chong</em>”), <em>PP v Sri Sutan s\o Rajendran</em> (no citation) (“<em>Sutan</em>”) and <em>PP v Muhammd Adil bin Amran</em> (MAC 900254-20) (“<em>Amran</em>”), respectively serial number 1,2,3, 4 and 5 in the table.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap8 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
