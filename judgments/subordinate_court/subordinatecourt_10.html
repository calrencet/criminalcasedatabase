class="Judg-Heading-1">INTRODUCTION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against conviction and sentence filed by the Accused after an extension of time was granted by the High Court on 20 November 2020 for him to file an appeal. The Accused had claimed trial to one charge of consumption of a specified drug, methamphetamine, and after a trial, I had convicted him of this charge and sentenced him on 30 March 2020 to 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment. After the extension of time was granted by the High Court, the Accused then filed a Notice of Appeal against his conviction and sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I now set out the grounds of my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Accused claimed trial to one charge: DAC 935085/2018 which reads as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">..charged that you, on or before 28 October 2017, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.), <em>to wit</em>, methamphetamine, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">and further,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 4 September 2000 in Subordinate Court No. 24, <em>vide</em> DAC33962/2000, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, <em>to wit</em>, morphine, under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 1998 Rev. Ed.) and punished under section 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years 6 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under section 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.)</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">PROSECUTION’S CASE</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Brief facts of Prosecution’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Prosecution’s case is rather straightforward. The Accused’s urine samples were obtained from him while he was hospitalised. The samples were tested positive for methamphetamine after they were sent to Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">What led to the Accused being arrested and hospitalised </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Accused first came to the attention of the authorities under rather unusual circumstances. It started with the police being dispatched to attend to a case of someone jumping down from a flat.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       PW1 Staff Sergeant Muhammad Sharul Ameen bin Abdullah Sani (“Sharul”), was performing ‘Fast Response Car’ duty on 28 October 2017 when he received information had jumped down from a floor in a flat. On arrival at Block 115, Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, he found the Accused lying on a mattress on the ground. The Accused was screaming in pain and there was blood on his body and hands as well as on the mattress. Sharul immediately called for the ambulance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, Sharul interviewed the Accused to find out more information about what had happened. The Accused informed him that he had earlier been attacked by someone called ‘Rashid’ with a knife inside a unit on the 5<sup>th</sup> floor. In attempting to escape, the Accused had thrown a mattress through the living room window before jumping out himself. The Accused had explained to him that he was hoping that the mattress would cushion his fall.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the course of the interview, Sharul noticed that the Accused had blood-shot eyes and a slurred speech. Sharul had difficulty hearing the Accused’s answers because of his slurred speech and had to repeat his questions to him. To Sharul, these symptoms are signs of consumption of controlled drugs. Sharul also found out that the Accused was a wanted person on the police gazette for failing to attend in obedience to an order of a public servant. He therefore placed the Accused under arrest pursuant to the police gazette and on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug. After the interview, the Accused was conveyed by ambulance to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accused’s urine was deposited into a urine bag through a catheter</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In KTPH, a urinary catheter was inserted into the Accused on the same day on 28 October 2017 in the Emergency Department at 3.47pm. This is documented in a report dated 25 December 2017 (P3) by PW6 Dr Lim Wei Xiang (“Dr Lim”). Dr Lim testified that he had prepared the report based on the clinical summary put up by PW9 Dr George Tan who had attended to the Accused at the Accident and Emergency Department.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the report, it was also set out the various medications administered to the Accused prior to the insertion of the urinary catheter. They are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Sodium Chloride;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Morphine;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Metoclopramide; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Tetanus toxoid.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     PW7 Dr Benedict Lau testified that he put up the medical report (P4). He confirmed that the clinical notes showed that whilst Dr George Tan attended to the Accused, he had wrongly stated in the report that Dr George Tan inserted the urinary catheter. He confirmed that the doctor who administered the insertion of the urinary catheter was PW8 Dr Cheryl Tan.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Dr Cheryl Tan testified that she was indeed the doctor who had inserted the catheter into the Accused. She explained the process in which she had inserted the catheter in a sterile fashion and confirmed that she had used a new catheter by peeling it off from the packaging. She had also used a new urine bag. She had inserted catheter into the urethra of the Accused and into the bladder. Once she saw the urine coming out, she took the urine bag and attached it to the catheter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Dr George Tan confirmed that he was the doctor who had attended to the Accused on 28 October 2017 at the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of KTPH. He also confirmed that Dr Cheryl Tan was the one who had inserted the urinary catheter into the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     From his clinical notes, Dr George Tan further gave the following information: The Accused was administered with some medication at the Accident and Emergency. Subsequently he was sent to the general ward on 28 October 2017 for further management of his conditions whereby he underwent a surgery on 29 October 2017 at 5.10pm which ended at 6.29pm. During the surgery, the Accused was administered with several medications such as Ephedrine, Morphine and Fentanyl. He confirmed that methamphetamine was not one of the drugs administered and according to his knowledge, none of the drugs administered would give rise to a detection of methamphetamine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Dr George Tan further informed that based on the clinical notes, it was recorded that on 29 October 2017, at 9.25pm, CNB officers Ahmad Fadzly, Ping Siok Hiok and Nur Fahana from Ang Mo Kio CNB came to collect urine specimen from the Accused for drug analysis. The 3 CNB officers came again at 11.10pm to talk to the Accused as the results were positive. Fadzly also asked for the types of medication given to the Accused during the operation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Dr George Tan checked his notes to confirm that the Accused was back to the general ward from the operating theatre at 9.10pm on 29 October 2017. He explained that as a patient would only be brought back to the general ward after he has attained a certain level of consciousness and able to protect his own airway breath naturally, the Accused would be awake by that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Obtaining of the Accused’s urine samples at the hospital </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     PW3, Senior Staff Sergeant Ahmad Fadzly Bin Bustamim (“Fadzly”), who was a staff sergeant at the material time with the Central Narcotics Bureau, was deployed to KTPH to obtain urine samples from the Accused. He arrived at night time of 29 October 2017, at about 8.45pm to 9.00pm and met the Accused at about 9:15pm<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> to procure his urine samples. He explained that ordinarily, upon arrest by the police on suspicion of consumption of controlled drug, the police can procure the urine sample from the suspect. Upon a positive test, CNB would be activated. However, in this case, as the Accused affixed with a catheter and a urine bag, the police officers were not so confident of procuring a urine sample from the urine bag and hence CNB was activated to do so<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Fadzly went to KTPH with two other CNB officers, PW4 Senior Staff Sergeant Ping Siok HiokHiok (“Ping”) and one Zulkarnain. Upon arrival, Senior Fadzly first identified himself to a nurse and informed her that he was there to procure urine samples from the Accused. The nurse led him to the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     When Fadzly met the Accused, the Accused was lying on his bed and was awake. Fadzly identified himself as a CNB officer and that he would like to obtain his urine samples. The Accused acknowledged by nodding his head<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. Fadzly then asked the Accused to choose one master bottle from a box which contained no fewer than 10 master bottles with red caps. After the Accused chose one master bottle and handed it to Fadzly, Fadzly then asked the Accused to choose 2 small bottles with blue caps from a box containing not fewer than 20 of such blue capped bottles.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Thereafter Fadzly then went to the urine bag which was at the side of the Accused’s bed and procured some urine from it by turning opening the valve to release the urine into the master bottle. He then closed the valve and went back to the Accused. The process of obtaining the urine took about 20 seconds.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Fadzly then asked the Accused to hand over the 2 small bottles which were still in his possession to him. In the Accused’s presence, Fadzly poured some urine from the master bottle into the 2 small bottles. He then capped the small bottles and taped them with a masking tape. Thereafter he placed them in a polymer bag before sealing the bag and handing the bag to the Accused to be kept in his possession. Fadzly thereafter informed the Accused that he was going back to his office to test the remaining urine sample in the master bottle<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Fadzly then went back to his CNB office at Ang Mo Kio Police Division together with Ping. At the office, Ping acted as the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) operator. The test was conducted at around 9.58pm on 29 October 2017 as set out in the IUT Result Slip<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Both PW3 and PW4 confirmed that the IUT showed that the Accused’s urine sample was tested positive for Amphetamine, Opiates and Benzodiazepines. This is documented by the IUT Result Slip as well.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Thereafter PW4 printed out the HSA labels and brought them along when she went back to KTPH with PW3. PW3 also brought along the “urine tong” which is a metallic box from HSA which comprised 2 separate metal boxes where only HSA has the key to unlock them.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sealing of the Accused’s urine samples</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     When they returned to KTPH, Fadzly informed the Accused that his urine had tested positive for the three drugs and that he would need to seal his urine samples for HSA to analyse. The Accused then handed over the polymer bag containing the 2 urine bottles to Fadzly. Fadzly then proceeded to show the Accused the 2 HSA labels which had the name and identity card number (“IC number”) of the Accused printed on them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Accused acknowledged his particulars on the HSA labels by signing on them. Fadzly then proceeded to seal the urine bottles in the Accused’s presence. He first cut open the polymer bag and thereafter he removed the tape on the bottles to check if there was any leakage. Once he checked there was no leakage, he taped the bottes again. He then placed the HSA labels on the two bottles and thereafter used a clear tape to seal the bottles over the HSA labels to waterproof the labels. Fadzly then asked the Accused to place the 2 bottles into the HSA ‘urine tong’. Fadzly subsequently went back to his CNB office at the Ang Mo Kio Police Division and placed the ‘urine tong’ in a freezer which is then secured by a padlock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The dispatch of the urine samples to HSA</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     PW5, Staff Sergeant Mohd Isa Bin Hassan (“Isa”), testified that he was deployed to dispatch urine samples to HSA on 30 October 2017. On that day, he had reported to Ang Mo Kio Police Division CNB office. He obtained a key to unlock the freezer to obtain the ‘urine tong’. He also printed out from the computer a urine submission form which he was supposed to hand over to HSA together with the ‘urine tong’.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On reaching HSA, he handed over the ‘urine tong’ to an HSA officer together with the urine submission form. The HSA officer opened the ‘urine tong’ with a key that was in possession by the HSA officer. After checking the urine bottles against the urine submission form, the HSA officer then made a copy of the form and returned the copy to Isa.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Isa further confirmed that the 2 HSA certificates<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> issued by the HSA analysts contain his name as the person who had submitted the urine samples to HSA.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of the analysis of the urine samples by HSA</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     PW10 Ms Ng Xue Qin, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA testified that she had issued the certificate confirming that the urine sample with the label marked matching the name and identity card number of the Accused was tested positive for methamphetamine. She also confirmed that methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The level of methamphetamine that she detected was 4,620 nanograms per millilitre of urine. Based on international guidelines which is adopted by HSA, the cut-off for a positive test for methamphetamine is 500 nanograms.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The second urine sample of the Accused was tested by another analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, PW11 Ms Kwok Yi Ling Miiko, who similarly testified that the urine sample bearing the name and identity card number of the Accused had tested positive for methamphetamine. The concentration of methamphetamine that she detected was 3,180 gram per millilitre of urine, which is above the cut-off level of 500 nanograms before a urine sample is considered to contain methamphetamine.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of previous conviction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     PW12 Woman Sergeant Angie Poh, who is the current Investigation Officer of the case, tendered the Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions of the Accused (P7). The Memorandum confirmed that the Accused was convicted on 4 September 2000 for one charge of consumption of a specified drug under section 8(b)(ii) read with section 33A(1) of the MDA and was sentenced to imprisonment of 5 years and 6 months with 3 strokes of the cane. This sentence was ordered to run consecutively with another sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for an offence of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug under section 8(a) of the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">DEFENCE CASE</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of DW1, the Accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Accused was the only witness for the Defence. After his defence was called and the standard allocution was administered to him, the Accused elected to give evidence in his own defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Accused testified initially that he did not “know” the 2 CNB officers who had taken his urine samples<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. He subsequently clarified upon questioning by the Court that not only did he not know them, he was not aware that they had come to take urine samples from him. All he could recall was seeing a nurse pouring his urine into some bottles<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Accused during his Evidence-in-chief had asked for his cautioned statement to be admitted. The statement was accordingly admitted (marked D1) wherein in response to the charge for consumption of a specified drug, the Accused had stated that “I did not consume any methamphetamine”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Subsequently, he also asked for another statement which he had given to the police to be admitted. In this statement (which was admitted and marked D2), the Accused essentially reiterated that he did not consume any illegal drugs such as ‘Ice’ before his arrest on 28 October 2017 and hence he did not know why his urine sample has been tested positive for methamphetamine. He also stated that he was not on any type of prescribed medications, supplements or traditional medicine recently.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Accused, when he was being cross-examined, was confronted by the Prosecution on his previous statement recorded on 29 October 2017 (the statement was subsequently admitted and marked P8) at KTPH by PW13 Sergeant Zulkarnain bin Azman (“Zulkarnain”). In P8, the Accused, although denying that he had consumed any kind of drugs and claiming that he did not know why his urine was tested positive for “Amphetamine, Benzo and Opiate”, did admit to his urine samples being obtained by CNB Officers. The relevant paragraph 3 is set out in full here:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 29/10/2017, a few officers that introduced themselves as CNB officers, came to my hospital, I was told that my urine will be taken from my urine bag. I gave my urine for testing. Thereafter my urine sample was later sealed in two small bottles, thereafter an officer showed me a label with my name and IC number. I checked and confirmed and sign (<em>sic</em>) on the labels. The two small bottles were then sealed and placed into a metal container. I was told that my urine sample will be send (<em>sic</em>) to HSA for further testing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Accused in P8 had given an account of his urine sample being obtained by CNB officers from his urine bag. He had also provided details of the manner in which his urine samples were signed and sealed before being placed into a metal container. However, when this part of his statement was highlighted to the Accused, he took the position that he disagreed with this statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. He also claimed that his IC number and the alphabet “Z” which were handwritten at the end of the statement were not written by him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. He further clarified during re-examination that all the paragraphs in this statement are correct save for paragraph 3<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Zulkarnain, the recorder of the Accused’s statement P8, then gave rebuttal evidence to confirm that he had recorded the whole statement including paragraph 3 based on information given by the Accused. He further confirmed that the Accused had written his IC number on the statement and signed his name with the alphabet “Z” using his non-master hand as his master hand was injured.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON WHETHER THE CHARGE HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Prosecution in the present case, took the position that section 22 of the MDA presumption did not apply but nonetheless the case has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt due to the overwhelming amount of evidence against the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused had slurred speech and blood-shot eyes when talking to the police officer, Sharul, at the scene, giving rise to the suspicion that he had consumed controlled drug. Hence the Accused was placed under arrest for consumption of controlled drug, even before he was conveyed to the hospital. The Accused did not challenge the evidence of the description of his physical demeanour by Sharul, going so far as to say in court that Sharul was speaking the truth.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It was next pointed out that the evidence given by the analysts from HSA was that the presence of methamphetamine detected in the urine samples of the Accused was consistent with him consuming the drug. Their evidence also confirmed that the level of concentration of methamphetamine in the 2 urine samples were significantly higher than the cut-off figure of 500 nanograms based on international guidelines.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that there was an unbroken chain of custody for the Accused’s urine samples and no possibility of contamination, starting from the point of the catheterisation procedure. The Prosecution relied on the evidence of Dr Cheryl Tan who had testified that the catheter and the urine bag were a new set and the catheterisation process was carried out in a sterile manner.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Prosecution submitted that the next part of the chain of custody was the evidence of the CNB officers. Fadzly accompanied by Ping, had testified that he had complied with the usual procurement procedure. He had allowed the Accused to select the master bottle and 2 smaller bottles from a multiple number of bottles. He also sealed the bottles in front of the Accused and obtained the Accused’s signature on the urine bottles before they were deposited into the metal box. The only departure from the procedure as set out in the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations, Revised Edition 1999 (“the Regulations”) was that the Accused did not urinate directly into the master bottle. However, Fadzly had testified that in front of the Accused, he had opened the valve of the urine bag and drained the urine into the master bottle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Prosecution then relied on the evidence given on the movement of the urine specimens to HSA. Fadzly had testified that he had brought the metal box containing the urine specimens and placed it into a locked freezer at his CNB office. Thereafter, Isa had brought the metal box over to HSA. The HSA officers also confirmed that none of the medications administered to the Accused could give rise to the presence of methamphetamine in his urine specimens.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Prosecution then rebutted the Accused’s argument that he did not see any CNB officers obtaining his urine samples from his urine bag.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Firstly, the Prosecution relied on Dr George Tan’s evidence that based on the clinical notes, it was recorded that CNB officers had come twice, once to collect the urine specimens and the second time to speak with the Accused about the positive result of the test. Dr George Tan had also testified that based on hospital procedures, post-operation, a patient would only be returned to the general ward after he has regained consciousness.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The final piece of evidence relied on by Prosecution to rebut the Accused’s allegation is the Accused’s statement P8. In paragraph 3, the Accused had stated the CNB officers had come and informed him that urine will be taken from his urine bag and he gave his urine for testing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Prosecution then pointed out that the Accused had initially admitted a further statement to P8, which is D2, to be his statement. However, it was only when the Accused realised that first paragraph in D2, paragraph 6, makes reference to his earlier statement P8, which he had denied to be his statement, that the Accused then asserted that paragraph 6 is not true.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Prosecution thus argued that the Accused has not raised any reasonable doubt to the case of the of the Prosecution which is that his urine has been tested positive for methamphetamine as a result of him having consumed that drug. Instead the Accused could only put up a fanciful defence that no urine samples had in fact been procured from him by the CNB officers.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CLOSING SUBMISSION OF THE ACCUSED </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In his closing oral submissions, the Accused asserted that CNB officers had procured his urine samples while he was unconscious and that he wished to “fight the procedure”. He also argued that he did not append his signature and did not place any bottle into a box. He claimed that he did not know the CNB officers and that the CNB officers also did not know him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Accused finally raised the point about his flat. He claimed that he is fortunate to have a flat and that if he had consumed drug, he would not have the money to maintain the property. Furthermore, he would not want to jeopardise his ownership of the flat by consuming drugs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     He therefore asserted that he did not commit the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">THE COURT’S ANALYSIS</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on the section 22 presumption</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I will first tackle the issue of whether the section 22 presumption of consumption will apply in a case where an accused did not urinate into the master bottle directly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Under the MDA, there are no prescribed procedure for the obtaining of drug urine specimen. The relevant provisions are section 22 and section 34 of the Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Under section 22 of the Act, it is provided that if –</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Section 31(4) of the Act provides that a specimen of urine shall be divided into 3 parts with a preliminary urine test conducted on one part and –</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    each of the remaining 2 parts of the urine specimen shall be marked and sealed and a urine test shall be conducted on each part by a different person, being either an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority or any person as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint for such purpose.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The procedure for the obtaining of the urine specimen from a suspect is instead prescribed by the First Schedule to the Regulations. The First Schedule envisages a situation whereby the suspect is able to urinate directly into a bottle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     This is evident from the following paragraphs of the First Schedule:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Paragraph 1</u>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A suspect who is required to provide a specimen of his urine shall be directed by an enforcement officer to wash and dry his hands.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Paragraph 3(1)</u>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The suspect shall then carry with him the master bottle and the 2 containers of his choice and be escorted by the enforcement officer (or some other officer authorised by the enforcement officer) to an appropriate place to provide his urine specimen.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Paragraph 4</u>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) The suspect shall urinate into the master bottle.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The officer escorting the suspect shall ensure that the urine specimen in the master bottle is that of the suspect and not that of any other person.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Prosecution highlighted two cases with written grounds of decision emanating from the District Courts where urine specimen have similarly been obtained not by direct urination but from a urine bag as a result of catherisation procedure.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the case of <em>PP v Amran Bin Sidek</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23640-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 201</a> (“<em>Amran</em>”), the District Judge had held that the presumption pursuant to section 22 of the Act is still applicable in such a situation but even without the presumption, the evidence was still sufficient to prove that the accused had consumed the controlled drug. On appeal, the Prosecution stated that whilst the conviction has been affirmed, the appellate judge, Justice Chan Seng Onn, in affirming the conviction, did not comment on whether the section 22 presumption would be triggered in such a situation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the case of <em>PP v Muhammad Farhan bin Zaharudin</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23751-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC  226</a>, the District Judge convicted the Accused on the ground that the case has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt without commenting on whether the presumption had applied. Similarly, the appellate judge, Justice Aedit Abdullah, had upheld the conviction without expressing any view on the issue of the section 22 presumption.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     What is clear from the above precedents is that none of the High Court judges had expressed any view on this issue. As such, this Court is free to come to its own decision.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I found the reasoning expressed by the District Judge in <em>Amran</em> persuasive. She surmised that the procedures set out in the First Schedule were, <em>inter alia</em>, to (at [75]):</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     minimise the risk of contamination of the urine sample by external agents;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     ensure that the urine sample in the master bottle is that of the suspect;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_c"></a>(c)     ensure that the urine sample which is sent to the HSA for analysis is that of the suspect;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_d"></a>(d)     minimise the risk of a suspect’s urine sample being mixed up with someone else’s urine sample; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_e"></a>(e)     ensure that the urine sample is not being tampered with.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I agree with this surmise. The Regulations are clearly intended to cover a situation where a suspect is physically able to urinate directly into a bottle and hence the regulations provided for the washing of the suspect’s hands and the carrying of the bottles by the suspect personally, accompanied by an enforcement officer to the place where the suspect then urinates directly into a bottle. The Regulations are silent on a situation whereby a suspect is physically unable to urinate directly into a bottle but is still willing to provide his urine sample as required by the law.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Accordingly, in a case, where a suspect is unable, due to physical trauma, to urinate directly into the master bottle, such as in the present case, the suspect should be allowed to give his urine specimen by another method. As long as the method would achieve similarly the above results enumerated in paragraph 66 above to ensure the integrity of the urine specimen, there is no reason why such a urine specimen should not be considered as that of the suspect for the purpose of section 31(4) of the Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Furthermore, as pointed by the District Judge in <em>Amran</em>, at [77], there is no specification in the Act that a suspect has to urinate into the master bottle or that the urine specimen must be provided in accordance with “such procedure as may be prescribed” in contrast with the position for dealing with urine specimens under section 31(4) of the Act which provides that the specimen shall be dealt with “in such manner and in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I accordingly find that the presumption under section 22 of the Act can still be triggered in a situation not covered by the Regulations so long as the method used to obtain the specimen would ensure that the urine specimen tested under section 31(4) of the Act is really that of the suspect and that it is free from any contamination.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the section 22 presumption is applicable</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I accept that the urine specimen was obtained in a manner which sufficiently complied with the safeguards envisaged by the Regulations to ensure the integrity of the specimen. There is no reason to doubt Dr Cheryl Tan’s evidence that she had used a new set of catheter and urine bag and that she had carried out the procedure properly in a sterile manner to drain the Accused’s urine from his bladder into the urine bag through the catheter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I also found the evidence of Fadzly to be clear and cogent. He had explained how CNB was activated to conduct the instant urine test on a suspect as the police was not familiar with obtaining urine specimen from a urine bag. Thus, he and 2 other CNB officers had gone to KTPH. He met up with the Accused who was awake and was able to communicate with the Accused. He informed that he was there to obtain his urine specimen and the Accused nodded his head. PW3 then gave a detailed account of the urine procurement process. The Accused then complied with his request to select one blue-capped master bottle from a box containing more than 10 of such bottles and 2 red-capped bottles from another box containing more than 20 of such bottles. This part of selection of bottles by the Accused complied with the requirement set out in paragraph 2 of the First Schedule to the Regulations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Thereafter Fadzly had drained out some urine from the Accused’s urine bag, which was at the side of his bed into the master bottle and poured some urine from the master botte into the 2 smaller containers in front of the Accused. He then sealed the 2 smaller bottles and handed them over to the Accused before proceeding back to his CNB station in Ang Mo Kio to conduct the IUT.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     After the testing had yielded a positive result, Fadzly had returned to see the Accused to inform of the result of his Instant Urine Test. He then took the 2 sealed containers with the Accused’s urine sample and checked the seal was intact. He showed the 2 labels to the Accused with his name and identity card number. The Accused acknowledged by signing on the labels. Fadzly then pasted the labels on the two bottles and further covered the labels with clear tape to waterproof them. The Accused then deposited the two bottles into the metal container.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Fadzly had thus complied with all the procedures prescribed in the First Schedule to the Regulations save for the parts that require the Accused to urinate directly into the bottle. Isa who couriered the bottles to HSA confirmed that the bottles were in order and there was no rejection by HSA on the ground that the labels were not signed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. The two HSA analysts also confirmed that labels had been signed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The Accused could only contend that he did not give his urine samples to the CNB enforcement officers by alleging that he did not remember seeing them. He also asserted that he did not know them and neither did they know him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I found that the Accused was clearly misconceived in thinking that just because Fadzly said he did not know the Accused, it meant that they did not meet each other at KTPH. Fadzly was merely stating that he and the Accused had not had any previous relationship or encounter and was meeting the Accused for the first time that day. This was also meant to show that Fadzly being a total stranger to the Accused would not have any motivation to treat the Accused differently from any other suspect or try to fabricate any evidence or testify falsely against him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I rejected the Accused’s evidence that he did not provide his urine sample to Fadzly. Fadel’s evidence of meeting the Accused to obtain the urine samples is overwhelmingly supported by the other witnesses. First was the evidence of his colleague Ping who had corroborated his evidence about the visit to KTPH to collect the Accused’s urine sample and thereafter his return to see the Accused again to collect the 2 urine bottles after the IUT. However, the strongest evidence came from Dr George Tan who gave evidence, based on the contemporaneous clinical notes, that it was recorded the attendance of Fadzly and his colleagues to obtain the urine sample of the Accused. He also provided evidence on the timing which corroborated the evidence of Fadzly on the time he had arrived at the hospital to see the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     He further corroborated the evidence of Fadzly that the Accused was awake as inferred from the fact that the Accused had been brought back to the general ward just before the arrival of CNB officers. This was because a patient generally would be brought back to the general ward after an operation only when he has regained consciousness.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Finally, the Accused’s own statement which was exculpatory in nature in that he had denied consuming any controlled drug, confirmed that the CNB officers did attend to him and obtained his urine sample from his urine bag. In paragraph 3 of P8, which had been reproduced above at paragraph 38 above, the Accused expressly stated that CNB officers had come and told him that they will take some urine from his urine bag. He also stated therein that his urine sample was later sealed in two small bottles and that an officer had shown him a label with his name and IC number and he had checked, confirmed and signed on the labels.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     This statement is a clear admission that the Accused was conscious and knew exactly what was happening when the CNB officers came to see him. It also confirmed that urine samples had been properly obtained from him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Accused did not claim that this statement was obtained from him involuntarily. He merely stated that this paragraph did not come from him and that he did not sign the statement and neither did he write his IC number on the statement. I disbelieve the Accused’s evidence on this point.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Firstly, it is clear that the statement as a whole is exculpatory in nature. The Accused had denied consuming any kind of controlled drug and asserted that he had not “touched any kind of drugs since 2005”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. This is consistent with his testimony in court. Hence it does not make sense for his statement to be fabricated against him only on this part of the obtaining of his urine sample when this aspect of his defence that he never gave his urine sample to any CNB officer was never made known to anyone until he came to court. Furthermore, if the intention was to fabricate evidence against the Accused, then the statement would have been inculpatory in nature particularly on the issue of consumption of methamphetamine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Secondly, I found that the evidence of the recorder of the statement, Zulkarnain that the Accused had signed the statement and written his IC number with his non-master hand due to his master hand being hurt was borne out by the visual examination of the signature and handwriting.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The signature on P8 was just a simple letter “Z” in contrast to the signature in his full name “Zaruddin” in a further statement D2 in which he had admitted to signing. His IC number was also written smoothly and clearly in D2 whilst the digits written in P8 were large, erratic and uneven in size. The number “6” was not written completely.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I attach the two signatures below with the one from P8 on the left and the one from D2 on the right for comparison:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0026_Image/[2021] SGDC 0026_image1.png" style="height:174.787722222222pt;width:354.815333333333pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Although the Court is not an expert on penmanship, it is very obvious to even a casual observer with an untrained eye that the manner of such writing in P8 is consistent with the writing of someone not using his master hand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Finally, in D2, the Accused’s statement that was recorded on 18 April 2018, paragraph 6 had stated that his earlier statement P8 had been read to him. He was then given an opportunity in D2 to explain why his urine was tested positive in relation to his arrest on 28 October 2017. His response was merely that he did not know the reason for it. There is nothing in D2 to dispute that his urine sample had been properly obtained by CNB officers from his urine bag.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     D2 was a statement shown and read to the Accused as part of Prosecution’s obligation to disclose unusued materials to the Accused. After the statement was read and explained to the Accused, the Accused had requested for the statement to be admitted as his part of his evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     However, subsequently when paragraph 6 was specifically read to him again and the Court had asked him whether this part is true, he denied by saying, “Disagree. I can’t remember.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It was obvious to me that the Accused upon realising that paragraph 6 of D2 had made reference to his earlier statement P8, then belatedly attempted to distance himself from it. I therefore found that the Accused had an opportunity to dispute paragraph 3 of P8 in his further statement D2 but did not do so because paragraph 3 did come from him and it was accurately recorded by Zulkarnain. The Accused had acknowledged the contents of P8 to be true and correct by signing on it and had written his IC number on it using his non-injured but non-master hand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I found that on the issue of chain of custody of the urine samples, there was no challenge of the evidence adduced by Prosecution that the urine samples were properly placed in the HSA metal box which was locked and the metal box was thereafter brought back to CNB office at Ang Mo Kio and secured in a locked freezer by Fadzly. Thereafter CNB officer Isa had brought the metal box to HSA. The two HSA analysts confirmed that the bottles of the Accused were sealed and the labels were signed when they received the samples.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     As for the testing, I found the evidence given by the two analysts were sound and unimpeached. Both confirmed the amount of methamphetamine detected was way above the minimum level by international standards to arrive at a positive testing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Accordingly I found that section 22 of the Act had been satisfied: methamphetamine has been found in the urine of the Accused as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), and therefore the Accused shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b) of the Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">If the section 22 presumption is not applicable</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     However, in the alternative, if I am wrong on the issue of presumption in that it will only be triggered if the urine specimen must be obtained by a suspect urinating directly into the bottle, I find that the evidence based on my above analysis was still sufficient to prove that the urine specimen obtained by Fadzly was that of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I found that the Accused had been arrested for suspicion of consumption of controlled drug due to him being observed by the arresting officer Sharul to display tell-tale symptoms of slurred speech and blood-shot eyes. Subsequently when he was at KTPH, due to the serious injuries sustained by him from a fall from height, a urinary catheter had been inserted into him for urine to be released from his bladder. I had already gone through my analysis of the evidence as to how thereafter Fadzly had been activated to collect his urine sample from his urine bag and I shall not repeat it here.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I will now look at possible defences and whether any reasonable doubt had been raised by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I have dealt with the contention of the Accused that he did not provide any urine specimens to CNB officers which I had dismissed. The only other possibility is that, since he claimed that he had not knowingly consumed any controlled drug since 2005, the presence of methamphetamine detected was due to administration of drugs into him prior to the testing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The Prosecution had adduced the evidence of the various doctors covering all the different types of drugs that were administered to the Accused upon his admission to KTPH. These included medications prior and during the surgeries he underwent as well as prior to the procedure of the urinary catheterisation. The doctors have confirmed that none of the medications would give rise to the presence of methamphetamine. Similarly, the 2 HSA analysts have also confirmed that the none of the medications from the list provided by the doctors would give rise to the presence of methamphetamine in the urine specimen of the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The irresistible inference and conclusion would be that the Accused had knowingly consumed the drug methamphetamine, which is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Act, without authorisation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The Accused, left with just a bare denial and the assertion that he has no reason to jeopardise the possession of his flat by going back to drugs, was unable to raise any reasonable doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and I duly found the Accused guilty and convicted of the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Submission by Prosecution </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Upon conviction, the Accused would face a minimum mandatory sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that the usual tariff for a plead guilty case is the minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. In the present case, as the Accused is past the age for caning, no caning can be imposed. The Prosecution informed that they will not be asking for any additional imprisonment term in lieu of such caning. Nonetheless the Prosecution asked for an uplift of 6 months above the minimum given that the Accused had claimed trial and should not be given the same discount as someone else who has pleaded guilty.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The Accused in mitigation asked for the minimum sentence as he was worried that he would lose his rental flat and hence would not have a place of residence upon his release from prison.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accused’s antecedent record</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The Accused has a long history of drug antecedents. He was sent to Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) on no less than 6 occasions for the following periods:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a"></a>(a)     4 October 1984 for 14 months;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b"></a>(b)     17 June 1987 for 6 months, which order was then extended by another 6 months;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_c"></a>(c)     15 August 1989 for 6 months;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_d"></a>(d)     28 April 1993 for 24 months;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_e"></a>(e)     24 July 1995 for 24 months; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_f"></a>(f)     19 September 1997 for 25 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The Accused was then convicted on 4 September 2000 for consumption of morphine and was subjected to enhanced punishment of a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years and 3 strokes (“LT1 offence”). He was sentenced to imprisonment of 5 years and 6 months with 3 strokes of the cane. He was also given a consecutive sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for possession of diamorphine offence. His total sentence came up to 6 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The reasoning for the sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The Accused having exercised his right of trial, would not be eligible for any discount in sentence afforded to individuals who have demonstrated remorse by a timely plea of guilt. The Prosecution had to call CNB officers, 4 medical doctors and 2 HSA analysts to prove their case. The Accused had failed to produce any evidence to seriously mount a credible challenge to the overwhelming evidence against him that he was aware of and he did provide his urine specimen through his urine bag to the CNB officers. Despite his admission to this fact in his statements, he chose to distance himself from such admission by blatantly denying his signature to the statement P8.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I thus found that the Accused did not deserve the minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment. On top of that, the Accused had a long history of drug consumption antecedents. He was sent to DRC on 6 occasions from 1983 to 1997 chalking up 80 months of detention. Hence for his LT1 offence, it was not surprising that he did not receive the minimum mandatory punishment but an uplift of 6 months had been imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Prosecution has therefore submitted for a short uplift for the present offence for an additional period of 6 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    However, given that the minimum sentence of 7 years is of a substantial length, I am of the view that a smaller uplift of 3 months would be adequate and accordingly imposed a sentence of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence (“NE”), 6 March 2020, 28/12-23.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>NE, 4 March 2020, 41/2-4.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>NE, 4 March 2020, 37/9-17.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>NE, 4 March 2020, 25/2-4.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>NE, 4 March 2020, 25/9-26/28.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Exhibit P2.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>NE, 4 March 2020, 54/7-8.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Exhibits P5 and P6.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 44/29-31.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 48/5-11.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 64/9-12.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 62/12-25.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_13_1" id="Ftn_13">[note: 13]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 71/24-72/11.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_14_1" id="Ftn_14">[note: 14]</a></sup>NE, 4 March 2020, 61/13-18.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_15_1" id="Ftn_15">[note: 15]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 34/20-23; and 39/4-8.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_16_1" id="Ftn_16">[note: 16]</a></sup>Paragraph 4 of P8.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_17_1" id="Ftn_17">[note: 17]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 66/1-22.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_18_1" id="Ftn_18">[note: 18]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 73/2.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_19_1" id="Ftn_19">[note: 19]</a></sup>NE, 6 March 2020, 33/3-34/19; and 37/31-39/3.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap8 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
