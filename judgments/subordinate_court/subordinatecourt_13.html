id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused person, Thiruvengadam Varadharajan (“AP”), pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the following charge:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“….you on or about the 24th day of March, 2019 at about 12.03pm, at the basement carpark of Blk 11 Chai Chee Road, Singapore, did commit mischief by fire, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby cause damage to the windshield of motorcycle Registration number FBC5153U, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 435 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">STATEMENT OF FACTS </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The statement of facts which the AP had admitted without qualification stated as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>“THE PARTIES INVOLVED</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The accused is Thiruvengadam Varadharajan, a 41-year-old male, Singapore Permanent Resident, Indian national, bearing the NRIC No. SXXXXXX.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The complainant is Lee Wee Boon, 33-year-old male Singapore citizen.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The victim is Muhammad Ruzairee Bin Ahsim, a 22-year-old Singapore Citizen. He is the owner of the motorcycle with the registration plate number FBC5153J (the “Motorcycle”).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>FIRST INFORMATION REPORT</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    On 24 March 2019, at about 12.13pm, the complainant called ‘999’ with text of message “A M/ CYCLE CAUGHT FIRE AT THE CAR PARK” The incident location given was Blk 11 Chai Chee Road, Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>FACTS RELATING TO CHARGE (DAC-909951-2019)</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    On 22 March 2019, at about 10.10pm, the victim left the Motorcycle at the carpark located at the basement of Blk 11 Chai Chee Road, Singapore (the “Carpark”).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Investigations revealed that the accused ended his work at about 8.45am on 24 March 2019. Subsequently, he went to a coffeeshop located at Blk 36 Chai Chee Road, Singapore, to have some food and to read the news till about 12pm of the same day. Thereafter, the accused left the coffeeshop and walked towards the Carpark.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    On 24 March 2019, at or about 12.03pm, the accused was in the Carpark and he walked towards the Motorcycle. Thereat, the accused used a lighter to set fire to a white cloth which was placed between the visor and the meter of the Motorcycle. He walked away from the Motorcycle. Subsequently, he turned back and walked a few steps towards the Motorcycle to check if the said white cloth of the Motorcycle was on fire. After ensuring the said white cloth was on fire, he walked away from the Motorcycle and exited the Carpark.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    On 24 March 2019, at about 12.10pm, the complainant was finding a vacant lot to park his motorcycle in the Carpark when he saw that the Motorcycle was on fire. Subsequently, the complainant called for the police. Thereafter, the complainant saw a Malay man extinguishing the fire by splashing water over the Motorcycle.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    As a result of the fire caused by the accused, the said white cloth, the meter case, and meter visor of the Motorcycle was damaged. The damage to the Motorcycle is seen in the photograph below:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0025_Image/[2021] SGDC 0025_image1.png" style="height:271.444958333333pt;width:195.653708333333pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    The victim made repairs for the said damaged and the total cost of repair amounted to $88.00, as seen in the document annexed herein as “Annex A”. The accused has made full restitution to the victim.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    The CCTV footage, which is annexed as “Annex B”, shows the offence above.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    The accused has admitted to the offence above.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did commit mischief by fire knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause damage to property, by using a lighter to set fire to a white cloth which was placed between the visor and the meter of the Motorcycle, resulting in the damage of the said white cloth, meter case and meter visor of the motorcycle. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 435 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">SUBMISSIONS OF BOTH PARTIES ON SENTENCE</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I accepted the defence submission that the mitigating factors in the present case are that this is the AP’s first brush with the law and he has been a law abiding resident to date. He is contrite and regrets the commission of his offence. His remorse is evident from his full restitution shortly after his arrest and his commission of the offence is attributed to a momentary lapse of judgment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I noted from the report dated 8 September 2020 from the Institute of Mental Health that the AP has developed an adjustment disorder with depressed mood at present due to the stress of his current charge, but by his own admission, he did not have an adjustment disorder with depressed mode at the material time of this alleged offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As the causing of mischief by fire is a serious offence based on the prescribed punishment of up to 7 years imprisonment and shall also be liable to a fine, the court is likely to impose a deterrent sentence which would largely be determined by the nature of the damage and the degree of planning in the execution of the offence, and the factors affecting sentence for a section 435 charge are set out in the table below<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="48.46%"/> <col width="51.54%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Seriousness Indicators (+)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Seriousness Indicators (—)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 Serious damage</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 Premeditated</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 Revenge</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 Intent to defraud</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 Serious injury risked</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 Group offence</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 Related to illegal moneylending activities</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>This list is not exhaustive.</em> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 Minor damage</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 Impulsive action</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 Psychological illness</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <em>This list is not exhaustive.</em> </p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       While I agreed with the defence on the above sentencing factors, I am unable to accept the defence submission that based on the 2 sentencing precedents cited by the defence, the AP should be given either a fine or a sentence of no more than 2 months’ imprisonment having regard to the AP’s culpability, mitigating factors and the sentencing precedents. As there is no evidence of any mental disorder on the part of the AP with a causal link to the commission of the offence, the causing of mischief by fire is a serious offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine. An imprisonment term is mandatory and a fine, if appropriate, is in addition to an imprisonment term, and hence, a fine alone cannot be imposed on the AP as submitted by the defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As for the 2 sentencing precedents cited by the defence which provided a sentencing range of between 4 months to 6 months, I agreed with the prosecution that they are distinguishable from the present case as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The accused in <em>PP v Lee Jun Xiang <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18864-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGDC 120</a></em> was convicted of three section 435 charges of intending to cause damage by using a lighter and newspapers to set fire to rubbish bins and the court stated at [56] that while the imprisonment term for each mischief by fire offence should be higher than the 3 months’ imprisonment proposed by prosecution and more towards a 6 month-imprisonment term, in view of the multiple offences committed by the accused and with a mind to order 2 of the sentences to run consecutively, the sentence was calibrated to 4 months’ imprisonment for each of the mischief by fire offences with 2 of the sentences ordered to run consecutively, making a total sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment. In my view, the AP in the present case faces only a single section 435 charge and there is no need for any calibration. Further, as submitted by the prosecution, this case did not involve the burning of motor vehicles but other materials in a different context.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The accused in <em>PP v Tan Yan Chong <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25141-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 239</a></em> faced 23 charges involving a range of offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008), the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) and the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, Rev Ed 2015) and was convicted of 7 charges, including a single section 435 charge of intending to cause damage by setting fire to the front door of an apartment and was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment for the section 435 charge. The court stated at [69] to [70] that that it was only fortuitous that the accused’s actions was witnessed by a resident from the same floor who had called the police and reported that the accused was trying to light the victim’s door on fire. It was also fortuitous that there were only burn marks on the door and the victim was not at home at the time of the offence. Based on these circumstances, the starting point for the offence ought to be six months’ imprisonment. Nevertheless, in light of his plea of guilt, the minor damage caused and his prior earlier remand of 28 days, this warranted a downward calibration of the sentence and the court imposed a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment. Further, as submitted by the prosecution, this case did not involve the burning of motor vehicles but other materials in a different context.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     Both the above cases did not involve setting fire to vehicles in a public car park, unlike the present case where the AP had set fire to Motorcycle parked in a public car park.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I accepted the prosecution submission that it was only fortuitous that more extensive damage to the Motorcycle and even other vehicles parked nearby at the same car park did not occur because a Malay man had extinguished the fire by splashing water over the Motorcycle even though the AP had walked back a few steps towards the Motorcycle to check if the said white cloth of the Motorcycle was on fire. Further, as pointed out by the prosecution, the Court should focus on the potential harm which could have resulted from the AP’s actions as the AP had set fire to the victim’s Motorcycle which was parked in a carpark full of vehicles with highly flammable substance (i.e fuel) in them and there were 3 other motorcycles which were parked near the victim’s Motorcycle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As for the 4 sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution which provided a sentencing range of between 4 months to 30 months, I noted that they were all unreported cases for which I had to bear in mind what the High Court in <em>Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0707.xml')">[2010] 1 SLR 707</a></em> had cautioned against relying on unreported decisions indiscriminately in determining the appropriate sentence for a particular case before the court since the detailed facts and circumstances of these cases were hardly disclosed or documented with sufficient clarity to enable any intelligent comparison to be made, and comparisons based on unreported decisions are difficult and are likely to be misleading because a proper appraisal of the particular facts and circumstances is simply lacking. Based on the brief facts given by the prosecution, I agreed with the defence that all the 4 cases can be distinguished from the present case as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     The accused in <em>PP v Hasim Bin Ramli (SC-903353-2020)</em> who was traced for unrelated drug and property antecedents was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment for a section 435 offence for setting fire to a pile of old newspapers which he had accumulated at a staircase landing and did not do anything after the fire got out of control and spread thereby causing damage to public property of $410.93 with no restitution. This is unlike the present case where the AP was untraced and had made restitution of $88 to the victim where the damage is 5 times less. Further, the accused in this case had started a fire on the 8th floor, at the staircase landing of a residential flat, with the potential of endangering the lives of the residents living there.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     The accused in <em>PP v Mohamed Salleh Bin Jumaat (SC-911592- 2019)</em> who was traced for unrelated drug antecedents was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment for a section 435 offence for setting fire by pouring lighter fluid to the victim’s motorcycle and setting it ablaze with a lighter after pushing it to the back of a rubbish collection centre located 3 blocks away from where he found the motorcycle and throwing two motorcycle helmets away valued at about $90 each. The motorcycle valued at about $6000 was totally wrecked by the fire which spread to a portable toilet about 1 to 2 metres away valued at $3,745. The total damage was $9,926 with no restitution and there was clear premeditation and calculation on the part of the accused who had committed the offence to exact revenge on the victim with whom he had a prior dispute. This is unlike the present case where the AP was untraced and had made restitution of $88 to the victim where the damage is almost 113 times less. Further, the accused in this case not only used a lighter, but poured lighter fluid (ie a highly flammable liquid) at the motorcycle at a rubbish collection centre where there are potentially multiple combustible items around.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     The accused in <em>PP v Yee Ching Hung (SC-911002-2018)</em> who was untraced was convicted of three section 435 offences which he had committed to express his unhappiness to his former employer, Samwoh Corporation, for alleged injuries suffered while working for them in order to disrupt the company’s operations and was sentenced to a total of 24 months imprisonment for the 3 offences with the sentences imposed for 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> charges running consecutively as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       In relation to the 2nd charge, on 18 November 2018, the accused took a candle from the backpack he was carrying, and placed the candle inside the engine compartment of the excavator, along with charcoals rinsed with charcoal lighter fluid. The accused then lit the candle. A supervisor working at Samwoh Corporation witnessed this and chased after the accused. The police arrived at the incident location and doused the flame. No permanent damage was caused to the excavator. However, as a result of the accused’s actions, the interior of the engine compartment was blackened. The accused admitted to setting fire to several of the company’s excavators on separate days, and to targeting the company’s excavators deliberately as they were the only machinery on site. The accused was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       In relation to the 7th charge, on 7 August 2018, the accused placed a wooden log into the engine compartment of an excavator and lit the log on fire. The accused left the scene thereafter. The excavator was beyond repair and its purchase price was $100,000. The accused admitted to doing the same on numerous other occasions. The accused was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       In relation to the 8th charge, on 6 November 2018, the accused was angry with his uncle and thus decided to set fire to his uncle’s house. The accused poured lighter fluid into his uncle’s unit, wrapped a cloth around the base of a candle and placed the candle on the floor. He then placed a padlock on the gate and left. His uncle woke up as he smelled smoke. The damage to the house totalled $3,590. The accused was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_c-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       In my view, the case of <em>PP v Yee Ching Hung</em> is clearly distinguishable from the present case as the 3 sentences had to be calibrated with no restitution made by the accused for the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> charges for much higher damage of $100,000 and $3,590 respectively. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> charges appeared to have been committed by the accused out of the desire to take revenge on his former employer with premeditation and the 8<sup>th</sup> charge was committed out of anger with his uncle and these together with the serious substantial damage caused, particularly in the 7<sup>th</sup><sup></sup>charge and less substantial damage in the 8<sup>th</sup> charge are aggravating factors not found in the present case where the AP had made full restitution of $88 to the victim. I accepted the defence submission that there was clear premeditation and calculation on the part of the accused in this case, unlike the AP in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     The accused in <em>PP v Loh Hsien Aik (SC-910010-2018)</em> who was traced for unrelated drug and traffic antecedents was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment for a section 435 offence (with another attempted section 435 offence taken into consideration) for setting fire to a motorcycle on 17 October 2018, at about 12.49 am after he was drunk and bored and felt the urge to set something on fire. He thereafter realised that the fire had spread to another motorcycle and the side of a BMW car. He lingered and watched the fire grow bigger, but did not alert authorities. By the time the firefighters arrived, it had spread to a total of 5 vehicles (4 motorcycles and 1 car). The damage totalled $103,244.81. In my view, while I agreed with the prosecution that this case involved similar facts of setting fire to a vehicle in a carpark with other vehicles nearby, the damage caused by the accused who was drunk in this case is very much higher than the present case with damage of $88 with full restitution by the AP and hence, the sentence of 30 months in this case is wholly inappropriate for the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">REASONS FOR THE COURT’S SENTENCE </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Having carefully considered the sentencing precedents cited by both parties as well as the sentencing factors and distinguishing features highlighted above, I am of the view that there is no basis for a sentence of 2 months as submitted by the defence and a sentence of 7 months as submitted by the prosecution is also disproportionate to the AP’s culpability having regard to the mitigating factors as set out in paragraph 3 above. I am mindful of the High Court exhortation that no two cases can or will ever be completely identical or symmetrical, the sentences cannot be determined with mathematical certainty but must not be arbitrary and must fit the crime.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Further, while past cases are no doubt helpful and sometimes serve as critical guidelines for the sentencing court, they are mere guidelines only and every case which comes before the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own circumstances<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the light of the low damage of $88 with full restitution made by the AP and having regard to the AP’s conduct in walking back to the scene of crime not to put out the fire, but to check that the white cloth used to set the fire on the Motorcycle was on fire, and that it was only fortuitous that more extensive damage to the Motorcycle and even other vehicles parked nearby at the same car park did not occur because a Malay man had extinguished the fire by splashing water over the Motorcycle with potential harm which could have resulted from the AP’s actions as explained above, I am of the view that 5 months imprisonment will be an appropriate sentence to impose on the AP.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Accordingly, in respect of DAC- 909951-2019, I sentenced the AP to 5 months’ imprisonment. In my view, the sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but wholly appropriate and commensurate with the nature and extent of the AP’s culpability and was a sufficient deterrent sentence tempered with proportionality without the effect of a crushing sentence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>See <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts at p. 961.</em></p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>See the High Court’s judgement in <em>Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0001.xml')">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 1</a> at [24]</em> where it was stated that:“No two cases can or will ever be completely identical or symmetrical. The lower courts, while obliged to pay careful and thoughtful attention to tariffs and/or sentencing precedents, must not place them on an altar and obsessively worship them. The judicial prerogative to depart in a reasoned and measured manner from sentencing and precedent guidelines in appropriate cases should not be lightly shrugged off. Sentencing is neither a science nor an administrative exercise. Sentences cannot be determined with mathematical certainty. Nor should they be arbitrary. The sentence must fit the crime. Every sentence reflects a complex amalgam of numerous and various factors and imponderables and requires the very careful evaluation of matters such as public interest, the nature and circumstances of the offence and the identity of the offender. Most crucially, it calls for the embodiment of individualised justice. This in turn warrants the application of sound discretion. General benchmarks, while highly significant, should not by their very definition be viewed as binding or fossilised judicial rules, inducing a mechanical application.”</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>As was observed by High Court in <em>Soong Hee Sin v PP [2001] 2 SLR 253 at [12]:</em> ”…the regime of sentencing is a matter of law which involves a hotchpotch of such varied and manifold factors that no two cases can ever be completely identical in this regard. While past cases are no doubt helpful and sometimes serve as critical guidelines for the sentencing court, that is also all that they are, ie mere guidelines only. This is especially so with regard to the unreported cases, in which the detailed facts and circumstances are hardly, if ever, disclosed with sufficient clarity to enable any intelligent comparison to be made. At the end of the day, every case which comes before the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own circumstances, and counsel be kept constantly and keenly apprised of the fact that it is just not possible to categorise cases based simply on mere numerals and decimal points.”</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap5 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
