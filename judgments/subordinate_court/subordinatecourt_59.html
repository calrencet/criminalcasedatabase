id="p1_1"></a>1       The Accused enlisted as a full-time National Serviceman in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on 14 December 2010. On 30 August 2013, he failed to report for his duty at HQ 2<sup>nd</sup> Civil Defence Division at 1 Tampines Industrial Avenue 3 and he was arrested by SCDF Provost officers on 24 November 2020. He deserted from service for a period of 7 years, 2 months and 25 days. He pleaded guilty to a single charge under section 24 of the Civil Defence Act (Cap 42, Rev Ed 2001).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I considered whether the primary factor in determining the appropriate sentence in this case was the length of the period of desertion and whether I should also consider the outstanding period of National Service the Accused was obliged to serve before he deserted. I found that only the former factor was relevant to the sentence and I sentenced the Accused to 24 months’ imprisonment. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has filed an appeal. The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The details of the charge are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>DAC 923831 of 2020</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You, Muhammad Haikal Hakim Bin Zulkifli are charged that you, being a full time National Serviceman in the Singapore Civil Defence Force who was rendering continuous full-time service at the relevant time and thereby subject to the Civil Defence Act, Chapter 42, having been notified to report for duty at HQ 2nd Civil Defence Division, 1 Tampines Industrial Ave 3, Singapore, from 30 August 2013 to 23 November 2020 (both dates inclusive), with intent to remain permanently absent without leave, failed to attend at your said place of duty without leave, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 24 of the said Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Accused is Muhammad Haikal Hakim Bin Zulkifli, a 28-year-old male Singaporean Citizen. He was enlisted as a full time Civil Defence National Serviceman on 14 December 2010. The Accused was posted to HQ 2<sup>nd</sup> Civil Defence Division, 1 Tampines Industrial Avenue 3 with effect from 4 April 2011.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 30 August 2013, the Accused failed to report for duty, and he continued to remain absent from his place of duty without leave, with the intent to remain permanently absent, until the day he was arrested by SCDF Provost officers on 24 November 2020. The Accused had deserted from service for a period of 7 years, 2 months and 25 days (approximately 87 months). He had neither a legitimate reason nor any medical exemption to justify his absence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       There were no charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The issues to be determined were:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The principle factors to be considered in determining the appropriate sentence; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the period of time that the Accused had left in his National Service before he deserted was relevant to his culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prescribed Penalties</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       An offence under s 24 of the CDA is punishable with imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Accused had no antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Initially, the Prosecution submitted that the court should impose a sentence amounting to at least half the period of desertion. As the Accused had deserted for approximately 87 months, the Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 43 months’ imprisonment. However, at a subsequent mention, the Prosecution submitted that they were no longer seeking a sentence of at least 43 months’ imprisonment and that based on the precedents they had tendered, they sought a sentence of at least 27 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Accused, who was unrepresented, informed the court that he had deserted when he had only four months of his fulltime National Service left to complete. He said that he deserted because he felt that he had been treated unfairly by his superiors and that he had suicidal ideations. The Accused claimed that he felt that the only thing he could do was to “run-away”. I noted that the Accused had not sought a psychiatric assessment and did not have a psychiatric report to evidence his mental state at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On an application by the Accused, sentencing was adjourned to allow the him to complete his full-time National Service liability. At the sentencing mention on 12 April 2021, he requested that the court consider the fact that he had now completed his full-time NS liability and that he had received an outstanding testimonial. He emphasised that he had deserted because he had “mental issues”. He further claimed, without elaboration, that financial issues also played a part in his decision to desert. He informed the court that he had been gainfully employed during his period of desertion in order to help support his family. He highlighted that he was a first-time offender and that he was remorseful.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relevant legislative provisions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The relevant provision of the CDA is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>24.</b> –Any person who being on duty, or having been notified to report for duty, with intent to remain permanently absent without leave, leaves or does not attend at, his place of duty without leave, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or any other punishment authorised by this Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Applicable sentencing principles.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In <em>Lim Sin Han Andy v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 1 SLR(R) 0643.xml')">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 643</a>, the Appellant had been absent without leave (AWOL), an offence under s 48 of the CDA, for a period of approximately 38 months. The Appellant was sentenced by a District Judge to 18 months’ imprisonment. Yong CJ affirmed the sentence stating the sentencing principles and considerations applicable to desertion offences, he held at [17] and [18]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    The trial judge held that the fact that the appellant stayed away from work to support his family did not carry any weight in mitigation. <b>This was because the public interest in National Service required the serviceman be prepared to subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the State</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    I did not think that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive. <b>National Service is vital to the security of Singapore and it necessarily entails sacrifices by national servicemen and their families. In order to safeguard the security interests of the State, everyone who is required by law to do national service must obey and carry out the lawful order given to him.</b> If the courts were to sympathise with personal difficulties of every national serviceman, the overall effectiveness and efficiency of civil defence or the Singapore Armed Forces would be severely compromised. <b>The deterrence of the individual offender, and others who might be tempted to commit the offence, is therefore necessary to advance the public interest involved in cases such as the present one</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> [ <b>Emphasis mine</b>] </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The underlying principles that affect National Service are national security, universality and equity. These principles were highlighted by the then Minister for Defence, DM Teo Chee Hean, during a Ministerial Statement in Parliament (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (16 January 2006), vol 80 at cols 2000 - 2083), where he said:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    Our National Service policy is underpinned by three fundamental principles. <b>The first is that National Service must be for meeting a critical national need - for it requires considerable cost both to the individual and to the nation. That critical need is national security and our survival. This is why NS men are deployed only in the Singapore Armed Forces, the Singapore Police Force and the Singapore Civil Defence Force, where they contribute directly to the security and defence of Singapore.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    The second fundamental principle of our National Service is universality. All young Singaporean males who are fit to serve are conscripted. If we have a system in which some are conscripted but others are not, there will be strong feelings of unfairness which will undermine the commitment of our NS men... MINDEF has always been very clear that National Service must be universal - all who are fit to serve National Service must serve.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    The third fundamental principle of our National Service is equity. Everyone has to be treated in the same way, regardless of background or status. His deployment in NS is determined by where he is most needed to meet the needs of the national defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> [ <b>Emphasis mine</b>] </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The principles enunciated by the Yong CJ and the first principle referred to by Dr Teo are relevant to cases of servicemen who desert from service or go AWOL. National Servicemen contribute directly to the security and defence of Singapore and there is a compelling public interest to see that National Servicemen perform and complete their National Service. They should be deterred from deserting or going AWOL as if this was left unchecked it would have severe consequences on Singapore’s security. I found that general deterrence was the key sentencing consideration for offences under s 24 and s 48 of the CDA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Appellant in <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em> argued, on appeal, that the trial judge failed to give weight to the fact he had gone AWOL in order to work to support his wife and child: see <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em> at [14]. Yong CJ gave no mitigating weight to this factor, stating that the public interest involved in National Service required servicemen to subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the State: see <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em> at [17].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I found that the primary sentencing factor for desertion offences was the period of desertion. This is because the longer the period of desertion the greater the loss to the State in terms of the offender’s ability to contribute to the security of Singapore. Other factors to be considered included, the rank and position of the offender, whether the offender deserted during a national emergency and, to a lesser extent, the offender’s reasons for deserting: see <em>Teo Yeow Wah Eugene v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7532-M.xml')">[2002] SGDC 51</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     An offender who held a position of command or responsibility had a duty to lead by example. Such an offender who deserted would have failed in that responsibility and would be more culpable than an enlisted National Serviceman who did not have such a responsibility. Desertion during a national emergency would also increase a serviceman’s culpability as he would be shirking his duty to the State when he was most needed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I found that, except in exceptional circumstances, an offender’s reasons for deserting from service would rarely decrease his culpability. As Yong CJ held in <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em>, at [17], the public interest in National Service required the serviceman to subordinate their interests to the interests of the State. National Service requires a sacrifice from all servicemen and, as such, an offender deserting because he needs to earn more money to take care of his family does not reduce his culpability because most other servicemen in similar situations serve their liability and do not desert.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the period of time that the Accused had left in his National Service before he deserted was relevant to his culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Whilst this point was not raised specifically in the Accused’s mitigation, I noted that the Accused said he deserted from his service with only four months left to serve. I have considered whether the length of service that the Accused had remaining before he deserted should be taken into account in his culpability. In other words, if the Accused’s culpability would be lessened if he had completed the majority of his National Service before he deserted.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Chief Military Prosecutor v Wang Yinchu</em> (MCA 5 of 2014), the Military Court of Appeal (MCA) addressed this issue. The Respondent, a sergeant serving his National Service in the Army, had been accepted, in 2008, by Cambridge University to undertake pre-clinical studies in medicine. In order to attend the course he had applied for a disruption of the 31 days of full-time national service would have had left at the start of the course. This application was rejected.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Respondent was informed by the university that if he was unable to join the course, he could re-apply in the following year but that there was no assurance that he would be accepted. Not wishing to take the risk of not being accepted to the course, he went AWOL in October 2008 and commenced his course at Cambridge. When he returned to Singapore in July 2014, he had been AWOL for approximately five years and eight months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At first instance, the General Court Martial (GCM), noted that the usual tariff where the offender had gone AWOL in excess of five years was the maximum sentence of 24 months detention. However, the GCM held that as the Respondent had gone AWOL when he only had a short period of full-time national service left to serve there it was not necessary to impose a deterrent sentence. The GCM imposed a sentence of three weeks’ detention: see <em>Wang Yinchu</em> at [5] and [6].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On appeal, the Chief Military Prosecutor (CMP) submitted that the duration of the period of AWOL should have the dominant sentencing consideration and not the length of full-time National Service remaining to be served. The MCA agreed with this submission and held, at [7] and [9]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    We agree with the Chief Military Prosecutor that the length of the period of AWOL is the <b>principal consideration</b> because it connects directly to the offence. In contrast, the period of service left is ancillary to the offence and goes towards mitigation only. For a proper consideration of the punishment of the offence, consistency and adequacy are important factors…. The respondent in this case had been AWOL for a period of more than five years and was determined to complete his education before surrendering himself to the Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”). This was a conscious and deliberate decision on his part as each year passed, and <b>his culpability for this offence is measured against the length of this time period.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    … The GCM also failed to take into account the need for general deterrence for like-minded individuals. Every serviceman may encounter personal difficulties during his time in National Service and remaining in National Service may entail personal sacrifices, both big and small. Those who choose to take matters into their own hands to avoid having to make personal sacrifices, especially for purely personal reasons, should receive an appropriate punishment. <b>The State must come before self.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> [ <b>Emphasis mine</b>] </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I would state that I am not bound by the decision in <em>Wang Yinchu</em> as that was a decision made under the military justice system. However, the principles espoused by the MCA are relevant and can also be applied to offences under s 24 (and s 48) of the CDA as National Servicemen in the SCDF and the SAF are bound by the same obligations, i.e. to serve the State in whatever service or capacity that they have been assigned for the duration of their full-time National Service.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>Wang Yinchu</em> the MCA had clearly adopted the same principles laid down by CJ Yong in <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em>, i.e. that National Servicemen have to suborn their interests to the interests of the State and that there was a need for deterrent sentences for offences of AWOL and desertion to ensure that National Servicemen do not put themselves before the State.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The MCA endorsed the principle that the primary consideration when determining the length of a custodial sentence was the period of AWOL and that the period that the offender had left to serve before going AWOL was not relevant to the offender’s culpability and should only be considered in mitigation. I agreed with this finding.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appropriate starting sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em>, Yong CJ referred to the case of <em>PP v Chia Kok Hua</em> (MA 531/92/01) where the offender had been sentenced to one years’ imprisonment for a s 24 offence and three months’ for a s 48 offence and noted that the offender has been sentenced to “a custodial sentence that was about half the period of his absence”: see <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em> at [11].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em>, the Appellant had gone AWOL for a period of three years, two months and nine days. The trial judge imposed a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment, which was slightly under half the period that the Appellant had been AWOL. Yong CJ noted this fact and held that the sentence was “about half the period of [the Appellant’s] absence”: see <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em> at [12]. Yong CJ went on to affirm the trial judge’s sentence: see <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em> at [19].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Neither <em>Lim Sin Han Andy</em> nor <em>Chia Kok Hua</em> established a benchmark, i.e. that the starting sentence for a desertion offence for offenders without relevant antecedents should be approximately half the period that the offender had deserted. However, I noted that this was, in general, the sentencing tariff adopted for first time offenders where there were no other culpability increasing factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There appears to be a dearth of reported decisions for offences either under section 24 or 48 (AWOL) of the CDA where the offender has no previous antecedents for similar offences. In <em>PP v Ahmad Zainudin Chia Bin Muhamad Zaki Chia</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20616-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGDC 219</a>, the Respondent had been AWOL from service for a period of about 11 months and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. The sentence was approximately half the period of AWOL. In <em>PP v Muhammad Rahmat Bin Sali</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19017-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGDC 153</a>, the Respondent was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for deserting from service for a period of approximately 15 months. He did not have any relevant antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I found that an application of this usual sentencing tariff, i.e. a sentence of half the period of desertion, for cases involving long periods of desertion would result in a unduly harsh or crushing sentences and I found it was not appropriate to apply this tariff in cases like the Accused’s. The Prosecution appeared to agree with my view as they had initially submitted for a sentence of 43 months’ imprisonment which was approximately half the period of the Accused’s desertion from service. After I expressed concerns that the sentence was exceedingly long the Prosecution revised its sentencing position and sought a sentence of 27 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In support of their revised sentencing position the Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>PP v Muhammad Fairuz Bin Abdullah</em> (DAC 10088/2011), the offender was sentenced to 42 months’ imprisonment for desertion from service of approximately 102 months. He had a previous conviction under s 24 of the CDA and had been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. I found that this case was not instructive as the offender had a previous conviction and, as such, specific deterrence would likely have been relevant.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>PP v Muhamad Sofian Bin Baharudin</em> (DAC 908779/2016), the offender had been sentenced to 28 months’ imprisonment for desertion from service for approximately 108 months. He had no relevant antecedents. I found that this case was instructive to the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>PP v Muhammad Raihan Bin Marzuki</em> (DAC 935898/2016), the offender had been sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment for desertion from service for approximately 102 months. He had no relevant antecedents. I found that this case was instructive to the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     In <em>PP v Muhammad Faizal bin Sahad</em> (DAC 7414/2013), the offender had been sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment for desertion from service for approximately 60 months. He had no relevant antecedents. I found that this case was instructive to the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>PP v Saleh bin Lamri</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22355-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 274</a>, the offender was sentenced to five years imprisonment for deserting from service for a period of approximately 156 months. The offender had a previous antecedent for desertion and had been detained in the SCDF detention barracks for going AWOL on three occasions. It would appear that the Prosecution applied the sentencing framework in <em>PP v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram and others</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21209-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 707</a> and submitted that the offender was within Peg 3. The Prosecution further submitted that the court should apply a 3.33 multiplier to account for the different maximum sentences under s 33 of the Enlistment Act (Cap 93, 2001 Rev Ed) and s 24 of the CDA. The Prosecution sought a sentence of five year’s imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The court in <em>Saleh bin Lamri</em> noted that the offender had deserted from service for a considerable period of time and that by the time he was released from Prison he was likely to be close to 40 years old and that he would probably be too old to fulfil his National Service obligations. The court adopted the Prosecution’s methodology and calibrated the sentence based on the framework in <em>Sakthikanesh</em> and imposed a sentence of five years’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the present case, I did not apply the <em>Sakthikanesh</em> framework both because the Prosecution did not submit on its applicability and because the offences involved different offences under different statutes with different maximum sentences. As such, I did not consider <em>Saleh bin Lamri</em> to be instructive in the present case. I did find support from the precedents that the courts have imposed sentences that are less than half the period of desertion if that period is a long, i.e. over five years.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the sentencing principles to the present case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The only aggravating factor in this case was that the desertion period was exceptionally long. I did not consider the Accused’s rank or the responsibilities he had in the SCDF as aggravating factors as the Statement of Facts was silent on these points. I also noted that there was no indication that the Accused had deserted during a national emergency.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I considered the Accused’s reasons for deserting, i.e. that he was treated unfairly and that he was labouring under a mental condition, to be a neutral factor in terms of his culpability. These reasons were unsubstantiated, and I found that without substantiation it would be wrong to give any weight to them. I also ascribed no mitigating weight to these reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In any case, if the Accused had been unhappy about how he was being treated by his superiors he could and should have raised this with the Manpower officer in his unit. I found that it was unacceptable for him to choose desertion as the first, and only, option to deal with his unhappiness with his superiors. This was especially so as he had already served the majority of his full time National service apparently without complaint.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I ascribed little mitigating weight to the Accused’s claim that he had also deserted because of his family’s financial situation. Once again, he did not substantiate this claim. As such, I found that his family’s financial situation was not so remarkable as to merit a discount to the sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I considered the Accused’s submission that his sentence should be more lenient because at the time of his sentencing he had completed his National Service. I assigned limited mitigating weight to this factor as I found that it would be contrary to the principles of National Service highlighted by Mr Teo Chee Hean, see paragraph [16] above, if servicemen were allowed to serve or complete their National Service at a time of their own choosing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Accused claimed that he had received an outstanding testimonial, however, he did not produce any evidence to substantiate this. In cases involving National Service defaulters charged under the Enlistment Act it has been held that subsequent performance by the defaulter “should not, as a general rule, be a relevant consideration for the purpose of sentencing”. This is because the defaulter’s subsequent performance reduces neither the defaulter’s culpability nor the harm caused by his offence: see <em>Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram</em> at [50]. I found this the principle was equally applicable to servicemen who desert from service. Therefore, I found that the Accused’s subsequent performance after he returned to complete his National Service did not have any mitigating weight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Finally, as stated above, at paragraph at [29], I did not agree that period of time that the Accused had left to serve when he deserted would have a bearing on his culpability. I also found that any mitigating value to be ascribed to the fact that the he had deserted when he only had a short period of service was cancelled out by the sheer length of his period of desertion.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On the basis of the length of the desertion by the Accused and the mitigating factors that he had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and that he had completed his full-time National Service liability I imposed a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I found that a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment not disproportionate to the offence committed by the Accused and that it was not a crushing sentence.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap6 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
