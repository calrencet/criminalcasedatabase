Investigations revealed that on 9 June 2020, the complainant was performing his duty as a Narcotics enforcement officer at the CNB office. At or about 11 am, the accused reported to Bedok Division, CNB office for his routine urine test. After providing his urine sample, the accused sat beside the witness at the front row of the waiting room. While waiting, the complainant noticed that the accused was talking to the witness who was reporting for her routine urine test as well. To maintain discipline and reduce interaction between supervisees, the complainant approached the accused and informed him to stop talking to the witness. The complainant then asked the accused to sit at the back of the waiting room.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6. Unhappy that he was instructed to move to the back of the waiting room, when the complainant asked the accused what his name was, the accused replied in the Hokkien dialect “kan ni na” and “chee bye” which means “Fuck your mother” and “Cunt” respectively in the English language (subject matter of MAC-904276-2020). Despite the complainant’s warnings to the accused to stop using abusive language, the accused persisted in doing so. SSSgt Yap tried to calm the accused down but the accused did not heed his advice and instead, challenged SSSgt Yap to a fight. As the accused grew more agitated, and refused to follow the directions given, SSSgt Yap and two other CNB officers informed the accused that they would be placing him under arrest.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7. In the course of the arrest, the accused used his right leg to kick SSSgt Yap’s right shin once forcefully, in the course of SSSgt Yap’s discharge of his duty as a public servant. Necessary force was used to effect arrest on the accused thereafter, given that he was uncooperative, agitated and was resisting the arrest.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8. As a result of the accused’s kick, SSSgt Yap felt pain on his right shin due. He sought medical treatment on the same day at Changi General Hospital. Dr Kant Abhay, in his report dated 17 June 2020, found that SSSgt Yap had suffered a 0.5cm abrasion over the anterior aspect of the right shin, as a result of the accused’s kick. He was diagnosed to have right shin pain after the assault and was not given any medical leave.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9. The incident was captured by the CCTV camera located at the incident location.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10. Following the above incident, the accused was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health after he was charged in the State Courts, from 10 June 2020 to 24 June 2020. Dr Lucas Lim, Senior Resident in the Department of Forensic Psychiatry issued a report dated 19 June 2020. The accused was diagnosed to have Anti-Social Personality Disorder, Hypnotic Use Disorder (Benzodiazepines) and Alcohol Use Disorder. At the material time of the offence, the accused was not of unsound mind, was cognizant of the nature of his actions and was found to be fit to plead. Dr Lim also observed that the accused’s risk of re-offending remained high, especially while the accused was in an intoxicated state.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11. Further, the accused, from 1 February 2020 to 20 October 2021, was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2014) (“Prisons Act”), which remission order was subject to the basic condition under Section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order was in effect, the accused, on 9 June 2020 had committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under Section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of the remission order, and the accused is thereby liable to be punished under Section 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 499 Days from 9 June 2020 to 20 October 2021 for the above offences.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) read with Section 50T(2) (b) of the Prisons Act.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3<sup>RD</sup> CHARGE [MAC-904723-2020]</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13. The victim is Goh Kim Pok, a 56-year-old, male, Chinese, Singapore Citizen. At the material time of the offence, he was an operations manager at Selarang Halfway House, a public service worker.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14. On 30 May 2020, at about 3.57pm, the police received a call stating, “male resident aggressive”. The incident location was given as the front security counter of Selarang Halfway House at No. 1825 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15. Investigations revealed that on 30 May 2020 at about 3.12pm, the victim and his colleague were doing their rounds at the residents’ bedrooms. When the victim and his colleague went into the accused’s unit, they saw the accused lying on the floor, beside his bed. The victim found a slab of seven tablets of Nitrazepam on the accused’s bed. The victim confiscated it for the purpose of referring the matter to the Health Sciences Authority as per the protocol put in place by the Singapore Prison Services.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16. At this juncture, the victim asked the accused to sign on the confiscation form to acknowledge the items that were found on him, but the accused refused to sign the said form as he did not wish to be recalled to serve the remainder of his sentence at Prison. The victim and his colleague then left the accused’s unit and returned to their front security counter.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17. At about 3.56pm, the accused went to the front security counter of Selarang Halfway House located at No. 1825 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore to sign the confiscation form. When the staff passed the form to the accused, he tore the form into two pieces and left them at the counter. The accused saw the victim at a distance away and he uttered the words “Pubor” in Teochew dialect and “Ka Ni Na” in Hokkien dialect, which means “Mother fucker” and “Fuck your mother” respectively in English language towards the victim, while the victim was performing his duty as a public service worker. </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18. After uttering the above vulgarities towards the victim, the accused grew more aggressive and tried to approach the victim. However, the victim’s colleague intervened and tried to stop him from doing so. The colleague issued a “time-out” form to the accused and asked him to leave the place.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">19. Further, the accused, from 1 February 2020 to 20 October 2021, was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2014) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order is in effect, the accused, on 30 May 2020, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order,</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">and the accused is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 509 Days from 30 May 2020 to 20 October 2021 for that offence.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 6(1)(a) punishable under Section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Chapter 256A, read with Section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 4<sup>TH</sup> CHARGE [MAC-910196-2020]</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">21. The complainant is See Bing Quan, a 30-year-old, Male, Chinese, Singapore Citizen. At the material time, he was a logistics officer.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22. On 25 October 2020, at about 8.37pm, the police received a call stating, “man jumping onto cars along Yishun Ave. 5, in front of Blk 740”. The incident location was given as Block 740 Yishun Avenue 5, Saint Luke’s Eldercare, Singapore.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">23. Investigations revealed that on 25 October 2020, at about 8.36 pm, the accused walked onto the public road along Yishun Avenue 5 near Blk 740, after having consumed several cans of beers with his peers. The accused walked onto the road, into the path of several oncoming vehicles as he wanted to be knocked down by a vehicle. As the oncoming vehicles were avoiding him and managed to prevent a collision, the accused then stopped abruptly in the middle of the road in front of the complainant’s vehicle. At this juncture, the complainant was driving at about 50km/h and had to jam his brakes hard in order to prevent a collision. The complainant managed to stop his vehicle from knocking into the accused.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24. At this juncture, the accused walked over to the driver’s side door of the complainant’s vehicle and the accused told him that he wanted to “find trouble” and challenged the complainant to a fight. The accused was intoxicated and began hurling vulgarities towards the complainant, saying “Ka Ni Na, you think I am old?” in Hokkien dialect, which means “Mother fucker, you think I am old?” in the English Language. The accused then threw a plastic bag he was holding onto the car’s bonnet and insisted again that the complainant fight him. After the accused threw the first punch, the complainant also engaged in the fight and parties exchanged punches until two passers-by intervened to separated parties (subject matter of MAC-910197-2020 and MAC-910198-2020).</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25. Further, from 1 Feb 2020 to 20 Oct 2021, the accused was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order was in effect, the accused, on 25 Oct 2020, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order. The accused is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 361 Days from 25 Oct 2020 to 20 Oct 2021 for this offence.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">26. By walking onto the road despite there being several oncoming vehicles and stopping abruptly in the middle of the road in front of one See Bing Quan’s vehicle, the accused has committed an act so rashly as to endanger the personal safety of other road users. The accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 336(a) of the Penal Code read with Section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27. The accused admits to the above offences and stands charged accordingly.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">TIC Charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Accused admitted to 3 other charges and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. Two of these charges were offences under the Protection from Harassment Act. The last TIC charge was for the offence of affray (section 267B Penal Code).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Accused has a series of diverse antecedents ranging from drug related offences to robbery. His most recent offences were committed in 2016 when he was convicted for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon and drug consumption. He was sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 5 years 9 months. He was released on a remission order for the period from 1 Feb 2020 to 20 October 2021. At the same time the Accused was placed under drug supervision for 24 months from 1 February 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution's Address on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Prosecution tendered a skeletal submission and submitted for a global sentence of 16 months' imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 200 days' imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Based on the sentencing framework in PP v <em>Yeo Ek Boon, Jeffrey</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21073-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 306</a>, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 15 months' imprisonment. This was in respect of DAC-909957-2020 (causing hurt to public servant). In addition, the learned DPP also submitted for an enhanced sentence of 200 days' imprisonment for the breach of the basic condition of the remission order.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Prosecution also sought a sentence of at least 2 weeks' imprisonment each for MAC-904723-2020 (using abusive words towards a public service worker) and MAC-910196-2020 (rash act endangering the personal safety of others) respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Accused pleaded for leniency. He also highlighted that he had alcoholic issue and an old mother to support.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Considerations</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In light of the fact that the Accused was convicted for causing hurt to a public servant and his antecedents, I was of the view that the main sentencing consideration must be one of specific and general deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prescribed Punishments </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I noted that the punishment prescribed for the offence punishable under section 332 Penal Code can be an imprisonment term of up to 7 years. The penalty for the offence under section 336(a) Penal Code was imprisonment up to 6 months or fine up to $2,500 or both. As for using abusive words to a public service worker, the punishment was a fine up to $5,000 or imprisonment up to 12 months or both.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Circumstances of the Cases </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In respect of DAC-909957-2020, I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case involved lesser harm and higher culpability. Hence, it was within the sentencing guide of 1 - 3 years' imprisonment as set out in <em>PP v Yeo Ek Boon, Jeffery, supra</em>. I noted the Accused had kicked the Central Narcotic Officer (<b>the</b> "<b>Victim</b>") on his shin causing him to suffer a small abrasion and pain. I also found the Accused to be persistent with his abusive and belligerent behaviour despite warnings given by the Victim. Moreover, the assault on the Victim happened in the waiting room of the CNB premises where there was another drug supervisee. These circumstances together with the Accused's antecedent for similar violence related offence enhanced his culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In respect of MAC-904723-2020, the victim was another public service officer. The offence took place at the premises of the Selarang Halfway House on 30 May 2020. I noted the Accused had behaved aggressively besides uttering vulgarities which warranted another officer to intervene and stop him from approaching the public service worker.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The final charge proceeded against the Accused took place on 25 October 2020, in the vicinity of block 740 Yishun, along Yishun Avenue 5. He was intoxicated and uttered vulgarities towards the driver who had to jam brakes to avoid colliding into the Accused. Other drivers also took evasive action to avoid a collision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Due credit was given for the Accused's plea of guilt and remorsefulness.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the other hand, I noted the Accused was not only traced for similar violence related offence but also other diverse antecedents. There were also 3 TIC charges which he admitted and consented for it to be considered for the purpose of sentencing. In respect of MAC-910196-2020, this offence was aggravated by the fact that it was committed while the Accused was on bail.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentences imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Considering the nature of the offences committed and the circumstances stated above, for DAC-909957-2020, I was minded to impose a sentence of 15 months' imprisonment as submitted by the Prosecution. But taking into account the fact that the Accused had been remanded at IMH for about 14 days for psychiatric assessment, I decided to mete out a sentence of 14 months' imprisonment. The sentence was within the sentencing range stated in <em>PP</em> v <em>Yeo Ek Boon, Jeffrey, supra</em>. There was no exceptional circumstances in the present case that justified a non-custodial sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As for the other 2 charges, I was of the view that an imprisonment term of 2 weeks each was appropriate to reflect the overall criminality of the Accused. The Accused has also shown to be a recalcitrant offender.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of Remission Orders</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In considering the imposition of an enhanced sentence and its length, I considered the Accused's level of recalcitrance and the factors set out in section 50T(3)(a) Prison Act. The maximum enhanced sentence was a term of imprisonment up to 509 days.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Prosecution chose to submit for an enhanced sentence in respect of DAC-909957-2020 only. For this charge, the maximum enhanced sentence was 499 days' imprisonment and the Prosecution submitted for 200 days' imprisonment. I agreed with the Prosecution for the following reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     This charge was the most serious offence committed by the Accused and he had breached the remission order within 5 months of his release. In total, the Accused had reoffended 3 times while serving his remission order. In these circumstances, I imposed an enhanced sentence of 200 days in addition to the 14 months' imprisonment for DAC-909957-2020. No enhanced sentence was imposed for the other 2 charges.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Given the fact that the Accused had committed 3 distinct offences, I ordered all the sentences to run consecutively. Accordingly, the Accused was sentenced to serve a global imprisonment term of 14 months 4 weeks and an enhanced sentence of 200 days' imprisonment. He applied and was allowed to defer his sentence to 16 February 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Accused is now serving his sentence.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap6 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
