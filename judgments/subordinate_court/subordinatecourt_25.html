Bin Hussin (“Accused”) stood trial before me on a single charge of failing to provide his urine specimen when required to do so by a police officer as prescribed under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). This charge carried enhanced punishment if convicted. Three other charges were stood down.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The proceeded charge read as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">are charged that you, on 27 December 2018, at about 10pm, at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters Singapore, without reasonable excuse, did fail to provide a specimen of your urine for urine test as required by a Police Officer of Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters, namely Sergeant Ken Ng Kok Wah, who was authorised to require you to provide a specimen of your urine for urine tests to be conducted under s 31 of the Misuse of the Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and you have thereby committed an offence under s 31(2) of the said Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, had been convicted, on 6 February 2003 in the District Courts No 24 (vide DAC 60144/2002), for an offence of consumption of a specified drug, namely morphine, under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), punishable under s 33A(1) of the said Act, and sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of cane, for which conviction and sentence have not been set aside, and that you are thereby liable to enhance punishment under Section 33A(2) of the said Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the close of the trial I found the Accused guilty of the charge and convicted him. I now set out my reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Shortly before the commencement of the trial, at a status Pre-Trial Conference, the Accused who had been on bail pending trial, sounded incoherent and made several references to being commanded by voices. In the abundance of caution, the Accused was sent to the Institute of Mental Health for a proper psychiatric evaluation to be undertaken to establish if the Accused was fit to plead and conduct his trial. By her Certificate dated 17 September 2020<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, the psychiatrist and Designated Medical Practitioner, Dr Tan Chunzhen (“<b>Dr Tan</b>”), certified the Accused to be of sound mind and capable of making his defence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Throughout the course of the trial, the Accused was on several occasions somewhat incoherent, laughed inappropriately as well as appeared to be responding to some non-existent entity. At various junctures during trial when he appeared to be responding to such unseen entity or voice, the court asked him if he was alright and in a position to continue with the proceedings. The court was therefore very mindful of these actions by the Accused and made sure that he was at all times able to follow the proceedings and was able to understand the evidence that was led against him by the prosecution and conduct his defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 27 December 2018, at about 12.25pm, Senior Station Inspector Tan Boon Leong (“<b>SSI Tan</b>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and Special Constable Sergeant Ken Tan (“<b>SCS Tan</b>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> attended to a call for police assistance at 2 Tampines Ave 4 Tampines West MRT Station, and established the location to be outside a barber shop.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       By the time SSI Tan and SCS Tan reached the scene, the Accused was already detained outside the barber shop by staff from the barber shop.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Accused had worked in the shop until about 2 weeks prior to the day of incident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Upon interviewing the complainant and the Accused, SSI Tan placed the Accused who had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> on arrest<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug.

He remained in the cell from about 4pm on 27 December 2018 until the morning of 28 December 2018, except for the occasions when he was taken out for medical examination by doctors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Besides a toilet, there was also a water dispenser inside the cell, which the Accused could use at any time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The following facts were established by both oral and documentary evidence tendered before the court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> On 27 December 2018, at Bedok Police Division, police officers had between 4pm and 10pm required the Accused to provide his urine specimen on 13 occasions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Police Station Diary (exhibit P7) corroborated the events and evidence given by the respective police officers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Senior Staff Sergeant Clarence Chan (“<b>SSSgt Chan</b>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> requested the Accused for his urine specimen from about 4pm. The Accused understood SSSgt Chan’s request but failed to provide his urine specimen. At half hour intervals during the following times, 4.30pm, 5pm, 5.30pm, 6pm and 6.30pm, SSSgt Chan offered a cup of water to the Accused but was refused by the Accused on the grounds that he was fasting. On each occasion when SSSgt Chan gave him water, he also asked the Accused to provide his urine specimen.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At 7pm, when SSSgt Chan offered the Accused a cup of water he drank the water. The Accused testified that he broke his fast at 7pm. SSSgt Chan also asked the Accused to provide his urine specimen but the Accused did not. Thereafter, at 7.30pm, the Accused was offered a cup of water by SSSgt Chan who also gave him his dinner, which the Accused ate. However, he did not want to drink any water. On this occasion too SSSgt Chan had asked the Accused to provide his urine specimen, but he did not. At 8pm, when the Accused was again offered a cup of water by SSSgt Chan he did not drink it nor did he provide his urine specimen to SSSgt Chan. The Accused was also reminded that the period during which he could give his urine specimen would end at 10pm on that day.

I found that none of the assertions by the Accused during the ancillary hearing affected the admissibility of the statement. He made up his objections to the admission of the statement as he went along during the hearing and most of the challenges were either spurious or afterthoughts. Some of his questions to the recorder were mainly on the manner in which he recorded the statement, which objections I found to be without substance. His allegation that the recorder promised him that if he gave the statement he would not be charged but released on bail<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> did not make any sense for me to place any weight. It is also significant that the statement was part of the CCDC process but the Accused had not raised any such objections at that stage.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Accused did not challenge the admission of the Investigation Statement recorded by Sergeant Irwanudin bin Razali (“Sgt Irwan”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> on 28 December 2018 at 1035 hours<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Based on the above, the Prosecution contended that the Accused who was required by SSSgt Chan and Sgt Ng to provide a specimen of his urine on 27 December 2018 between 4pm to 10pm, for suspected consumption of a controlled drug failed to provide a specimen of his urine without any reasonable excuse.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As it was clear that a <em>prima facie</em> case had been made out on the evidence, the Accused was called upon to enter his Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Accused’s defence was multi-fold and at times incoherent. He appeared to be making up his Defence as the case proceeded. One of his main defences was that he had attempted to give an insufficient amount of his urine in the morning of 28 December 2018 which was rejected by Sgt Irwan and or Sergeant Guan Zhenfu (“Sgt Guan”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>. He also ran the Defence that he was unable to provide the specimen required on 27 December 2018 either because he was fasting or due to injury suffered at the time he was arrested or some vague illness or condition that made it difficult for him to provide the urine specimen as required.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Sections 31(1) and 31(2) of the MDA provide:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Urine tests</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>31.</b>—(1)    Any officer of the Bureau, immigration officer or police officer not below the rank of sergeant may, if he reasonably suspects any person to have committed an offence under section 8(<em>b</em>), require that person to provide a specimen of his urine for urine tests to be conducted under this section.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    A person who fails, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of his urine within such time as may be required by any of the officers referred to in subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Once the requirements for asking an Accused to provide his urine specimen is satisfied, an Accused will be under a legal duty to do so unless he has a reasonable excuse for not doing so. In the absence of any guidance in the MDA, on what amounts to reasonable excuse, it would be a question of fact in each case based on all the objective evidence if the excuse given is a reasonable one for the failure to provide a specimen. The court has to consider if the Accused has proved, on a balance of probabilities, that he had a reasonable excuse for not providing a urine specimen as required under the Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The basic provision dealing with the burden of proof on an accused is section 107, Evidence Act which provides:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The proviso ‘without reasonable excuse’ requires the accused to show the existence of facts and circumstances that establishes such excuse as mandated by section 108 of the Evidence Act which clearly stipulates:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>108.</b> When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As regards what amounts to <em>reasonable excuse</em> it would be useful to refer to cases that have dealt with a similar provision involving failure to provide bodily specimens, namely breath specimen in drink driving cases under section 70(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed). One such case was <b><em>Madiaalakan s/o Muthusamy v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 3 SLR(R) 0580.xml')">[2001] 3 SLR(R) 580</a>. In dealing with the term <em>reasonable excuse</em> under section 47 of the Passports Act (Cap 220, 2008 Rev Ed), See Kee Oon J in <b><em>Ma Wenjie v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21858-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 137</a> considered the decision of Yong CJ in <b><em>Madiaalakan</em></b> to set in context and explain the proviso succinctly as follows at [32] to [33]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yong CJ held that there are three questions to be answered (at [9] – [12]): firstly, what amounted to a reasonable excuse; secondly, whether the offender had a reasonable excuse; thirdly, whether the Prosecution has negatived the defence. Regarding the first question, Yong CJ held that no excuse can be deemed reasonable unless the person had tried as hard as he could to perform what he was legally bound to do. In relation to the second question, he held that there were both objective and subjective elements. Regarding the third question, Yong CJ held that the Prosecution had negatived the defence because the offender did not tell the officer administering the Breath Evidentiary Analyser test about his alleged illness at the point his breath specimen was taken. <em>Madiaalakan</em> was later followed in <em>Derek Lim</em>, which also involved the issue of reasonable excuse in the context of failing to give an adequate breath specimen…..</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">33 …. The criterion that an accused must have tried his best before he can rely on the “reasonable excuse” defence was established in the context of failing to provide a breath specimen in <em>Madiaalakan</em>. It is notable that in setting out this criterion, Yong CJ (at [9]) adopted the tests set out in <em>R v Lennard</em> [1973] 2 ALL ER 831 and <em>Cotgrove v Cooney</em> [1987] RTR 124, both of which are also cases involving the provision of sufficient breath specimens. There is no indication that this criterion is equally applicable to cases outside the context of the provision of breath specimens. In fact, the need to try one’s best is only appropriate in cases of provisions of breath specimens (or other bodily specimens) where the law imposes a positive duty on a person and there is an element of physical exertion in performing that duty. In my assessment, the criterion of whether one has tried one’s best should be narrowly confined to scenarios requiring forms of physical exertion, in the context of fulfilling a positive legal duty. <b>An analogous example would be the failure to provide a urine specimen in relation to suspected drug consumption</b>. (emphasis added)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Following from the above, the Accused would need to show that he was physically or mentally unable to provide a urine specimen or the provision of the specimen would entail a substantial risk to his health or that he was unable to provide a specimen despite having tried as hard as he could.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The two main issues to be determined are as follows: (a) whether the Accused knew he was required to provide his urine specimen; and (b) whether the Accused had a reasonable excuse not to provide his urine specimen.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Whether the Accused knew he was required to provide his urine specimen.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The evidence led by Prosecution clearly established that SSSgt Chan and Sgt Ng required the Accused to provide his urine specimen on 27 December 2018. In particular, with reference to the charge, Sgt Ng had notified the Accused to provide his urine on 27 December 2018 at about 10pm. The Accused was fully aware of this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> I carefully reviewed the Accused’s evidence where he questioned the various entries on the Police Station Diary (exhibit P7) and found that his assertions were absolutely without any substance. I found him to constantly prevaricate on the stand whilst questioning the police officers who had made the relevant contemporaneous entries in exhibit P7. I have no doubts at all that he was fully aware of the duty to provide his urine specimen on 27 December 2018 but failed to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Whether the Accused had a reasonable excuse not to provide his urine specimen </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the evidence I found that the Accused had no reasonable excuse. He was not suffering from any physical or mental illness which may have prevented him from providing his urine specimen at the material time. The Accused did not even attempt to provide a specimen, let alone try as hard as he could to provide his urine specimen. For reasons best known to him, he refused to provide his urine specimen as required.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fasting</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I will now deal with some of the reasons he gave for his inability to give a urine specimen. Although he was in fact found with food packets on him at the time of his arrest on 27 December 2018, he claimed that he was fasting on the day, a Thursday. His story was that he could not eat or drink before 7pm on the day. He was therefore unable to provide his urine specimen. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Even if it was accepted that the Accused was fasting on the day, it defies logic that between 7pm to 10pm despite access to water as well as being physically provided with water by SSSgt Chan and Sgt Ng, he did not provide his specimen.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Water Retention in Legs</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It was rather ingenious of the Accused to claim on the stand that he had a water retention issue in his legs if he drank too much water.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Although he had mentioned a stomach operation in his statements to the Police, he had strikingly omitted any reference to this alleged water retention issue in his statements as a cause that prevented him from giving his urine specimen. In fact during cross examination by the learned DPP, the Accused admitted that he had no water retention issues on 27 December 2018.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Medical Reasons</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Accused listed some medical reasons besides the water retention issue for his inability to provide the required urine specimen. He attributed his difficulty to a stomach operation he had in the past and his gall bladder surgery in October 2017. The prosecution led evidence from two doctors to rebut this claim. Dr Wong Yu Jun Eugene (“Dr Wong”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> testified that the Accused’s stomach procedure and gallbladder removal surgery in 2017 would not have affected his ability to urinate. He also stated quite categorically that the gallbladder procedure could not have affected his ability to urinate as the gall bladder is not connected to the urinary system. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Dr Chareonsri Apiwat (“Dr Apiwat”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>, who had examined the Accused on 27 December 2018 certified that Accused was medically fit to provide his urine specimen. Dr Apiwat had checked with the Accused if he had any history of kidney or bladder problems. The Accused had told him that he did not have any such problems. Dr Apiwat also examined the Accused for any urinary tract infection symptoms by asking the Accused if he had any pain in passing urine or experienced any increased frequency in passing urine. The Accused answered both questions in the negative. This clearly showed that there was no urinary tract infection that could have affected the Accused in providing a specimen. In light of the clear and incontrovertible medical evidence, I found that the Accused’s claim had no substance at all.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Further, Dr Yak had testified that when he medically examined the Accused on 27 December 2018, the Accused did not inform him that he was physically unable to urinate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In dealing with his various excuses, it did not escape my attention that during the course of cross examination the Accused admitted that there was really no medical reason that prevented him from providing his urine specimen on 27 December 2018.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> While I was prepared to disregard his somewhat befuddled explanations of implanted cameras, speakers and microphones in his body that prevented him from urinating, I could not overlook the fact that he unwittingly disclosed perhaps the more telling reason why he refused to provide his urine specimen on the day of his arrest on 27 December 2018. When the Accused was remanded at the IMH prior to the commencement of this trial to determine if he was fit to continue with the trial, he was tested for controlled drugs, two days after his admission. He was tested positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> During the cross examination of Dr Tan he questioned the doctor of the need to take his urine specimen. He further stated that he would not have given his urine specimen to the IMH at all had he known that it would be sent for urine testing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> He would <em>“clean [his urine] for 2 days”</em> by going <em>“all out”</em> drinking <em>“as much water… as I can”</em> before he gave his urine specimen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> He further added that he needed to drink about four to five 1-litre bottles of water to clean his urine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Based on his experience, he explained that about 48 hours was needed to <em>“clean [his] urine”</em> – and that six hours was not enough length of time for him to do so. He further added that he would only give his urine specimen two days after consuming controlled drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> If he takes drugs within two days of the urine test and he does not clean his urine, the urine test “definitely will be positive”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> I could not but find that the Accused in refusing to give his urine specimen on 27 December 2018, in all probability knew of the consequences and hence refused to provide the specimen as he did not have sufficient time to rid any controlled substance from his body.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I accordingly found him guilty of the charge and convicted him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     After conviction the Accused wanted time till 30 January 2021 to sort out his affairs, in particular to collect his savings from his CPF account on reaching his 55<sup>th</sup> birthday. I granted the request and the hearing for submissions on sentence was adjourned.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Upon conviction, the Accused agreed to have three other charges that were stood down taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence. These charges were:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     One count of possession of diamorphine, a class A controlled drug which is an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

a sentence of 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment on the Accused. She highlighted that the Accused had soon after his release from his earlier LT2 sentence on 26 March 2016 and having been placed on twenty-four months’ drug supervision committed the present set of offences. She further submitted that a term of 8 years’ imprisonment should be the sentence for a second LT2 offence as suggested by the learned CJ Menon in <b><em>Cheang Geok Lin v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21996-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 548</a> at [34] where he had endorsed a similar approach in two earlier cases of <b><em>PP v Krishnasamy s/o Suppiah</em></b><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0321.xml')">[2011] SGDC 321</a> and <b><em>Yusran bin Yusoff v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0074.xml')">[2014] SGHC 74</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In his mitigation, the Accused stated that he had given information on traffickers and had asked CNB for time to go for his urine tests. He also stated that he had a dependent wife and that he was getting on in age. He asked that his sentence be backdated without realising that he had all along been on bail.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Accused is a recalcitrant offender. It appears from the chronology of events that whilst he was still under drug supervision, he committed the further offences of failure to report for urine tests, ie on 24 July 2017 and 4 August 2017 and on 27 July 2017 was found in possession of diamorphine. He has admitted to these offences and agreed to have these taken into consideration for sentence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> When he was arrested for the offence for which he has now been convicted he deliberately failed to provide the urine specimen knowing very well that it will incriminate him further.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I agreed with the submissions on sentence by the learned DPP, in particular on how the sentence for a second LT2 offender ought to be assessed following the clear guidance from Menon CJ in <b><em>Cheang Geok Lin v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21996-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 548</a>. The entirety of circumstances in this case plainly justified a sentence above the mandatory minimum given the lack of remorse evident from the fact that the Accused had scant regard to the opportunity given for his rehabilitation by his early release on supervision on 26 March 2016. He committed the present set of offences starting from July 2017, barely a year after release.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In assessing the appropriate sentence, I took into account that he was 55 years old and will not be liable for caning pursuant to section 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). I also considered the period from 7 September to 21 September 2020 when he was in remand at IMH for psychiatric evaluation to determine if he was fit to plead. I also gave some allowance to the fact that he was diagnosed with <em>Substance Induced Psychosis</em> by the psychiatrist Dr Tan who had also observed that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The accused presents a risk of reoffending in view of his history of illicit drug use, lack of a structured routine and supervision in the community and poor insight into his mental health needs.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However, the Accused’s repeat drug offences shortly after release from his earlier incarceration for an LT2 offence clearly warranted a sentence higher than the mandatory minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Accused has now appealed against his conviction and sentence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Certification of Designated Medical Practitioner, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, dated 17 September 2020 (exhibit P14).</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>In her medical report dated 18 September 2020 (exhibit P11), Dr Tan had similarly opined that the Accused was not of unsound mind at the material time of the alleged offences and was fit to plead in a court of law.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>PW1.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>PW2.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>NEs Day 2, p 21 lines 1-7.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>NEs Day 2, p 22 lines 31-32.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>NEs Day 2, p 24 lines 30-32;
