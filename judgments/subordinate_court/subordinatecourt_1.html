class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Accused, male, 40 years old, had pleaded guilty to the following three charges: one charge of procuring the commission of an obscene act by a young person under s 7(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38) (“CYPA”); one charge of commission of an obscene act with a young person under s 7(a) of CYPA and one charge of causing a minor under 16 to sexually penetrate under s 376A(1)(c) punishable under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). He also agreed to have four other charges under s 7(a) of CYPA and two other charges under s 7(b) of CYPA to be taken into consideration for the purpose of his sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing submissions on sentence, I imposed a global sentence of 33 months imprisonment term upon the Accused. Being dissatisfied with the sentence, the Prosecution had filed a notice of appeal against the sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I now give the grounds for my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following three charges:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910502/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014 inside your car in Singapore did procure the commission of an obscene act by a young person…by making him touch your penis (skin to skin), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38).”;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910503/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014, at your place of residence in Singapore did commit an obscene act with a young person…by showering naked with him and masturbating the said [young person] during shower, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38).”;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910506/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014, at your place of residence inside the bedroom in Singapore did cause a man under the age of 16 years of age…to penetrate your mouth with his penis, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 376A(1)(c) and punishable under section 376A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”;</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Accused also admitted and consented to have the following six charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910498/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014, in Singapore did commit an indecent act with a young person…by kissing him on the lips, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38).”;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910499/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014 inside your car in Singapore did commit an indecent act with a young person…by touching his penis (over a layer of clothing), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38).”;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910500/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014 inside your car in Singapore did commit an indecent act with a young person…by putting your hand underneath his pants and touch his penis (skin to skin), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38).”;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910501/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014 inside your car in Singapore did procure the commission of an obscene act by a young person…by making him touch your penis (over clothing), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38).”;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910504/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014, at your place of residence in Singapore did procure the commission of an obscene act by a young person…by showering naked with him and making the said [young person] to masturbate you during the shower, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38).”; and</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 910505/2020</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “…that you, sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014, at your place of residence inside your bedroom, in Singapore, did commit an obscene act with a young person…by masturbating him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38).”;</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Statement of Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The salient parts of the Statement of Facts relating to the proceeded charges, which the Accused admitted to without any qualification, are summarised below:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    PERSONS INVOLVED</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The victim is [redacted], male, 21 years old [he was between 14 and 15 years old at the material of time], Singapore Citizen.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The Accused is Phoo Siang Qing, male, Chinese, 40 years old [he was about 33 years old at the material time]. At the material time, he worked as a full-time freelance tennis coach.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    BACKGROUND</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    In 2011, when he was in Secondary 1, the victim took up tennis as his school Co-Curriculum Activity (CCA) and the Accused was his school tennis coach.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The victim began getting to know the Accused better and growing closer to the Accused around June 2013, while on a trip with the victim’s tennis friends and the Accused to Malaysia for a friendly match. At this time, tennis training in school was conducted twice a week, and the victim’s parents enrolled him for additional training lessons with the Accused as the victim wanted to train more.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    There were occasions where the Accused would invite the victim to go for dinner before dropping the victim off at the car park at the victim’s home. There were occasions where the Accused would also ask the victim if the victim wanted to watch a movie with him, and the victim thought that the Accused was trying to be like a brother to him when the Accused did so. The Accused also began bringing the victim to visit his house.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    After some time, the Accused suddenly began kissing the victim’s cheek and forehead while saying goodbye to the victim when dropping the victim off at the victim’s home. The Accused subsequently asked the victim if he could kiss the victim’s lips but the victim was reluctant. The Accused continued to persist in asking the victim until the victim relented and allowed the Accused to kiss his lips. From that day on, the Accused would kiss the victim on the lips to say goodbye whenever he drove the victim home. After a while, this became the norm for the victim. Gradually, the Accused and victim began to hug and kiss each other in the car or at the Accused’s house when no one else was around.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Later on, the Accused began touching the victim’s thigh when they were alone together in the Accused’s car. For the first few occasions, the victim would push the Accused’s hand away. However, the victim allowed it when the Accused continued doing so. Following that, the Accused began touching the victim’s penis from outside his shorts on these occasions. Next, the Accused inserted his hand underneath the victim’s shorts to touch his penis (skin to skin). The Accused also took the victim’s hands to place over the Accused’s pants, and later underneath the Accused’s pants to touch the Accused’s penis (skin to skin). Similarly, for the first few times, the victim was reluctant, but gave in after persuasion from the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    There were also occasions when the victim would follow the Accused home after training, and they would shower in the kitchen toilet together. The Accused would shower and apply soap on the victim’s body and would masturbate the victim. The Accused also told the victim to do the same to him and the victim complied.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC 910502/2020</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    Sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014, when both the Accused and victim were inside the Accused’s car, the Accused took the victim’s hand, placed it under his pants and made the victim touch his penis (skin to skin).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused had procured the commission of an obscene act by the victim, a young person, and has thereby committed an offence under Section 7(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act, Chapter 38.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC 910503/2020</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014, when they were at the Accused’s house, the Accused invited the victim to shower together in the kitchen toilet. The victim then showered naked with the Accused. During the shower, the Accused washed, soaped and masturbated the victim. He also asked the victim to do the same to him and the victim complied.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused had committed an obscene act with the victim, a young person, and has thereby committed an offence under Section 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act, Chapter 38.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC 910506/2020</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    Sometime between around June 2013 and around March 2014, when they were in the Accused’s bedroom at the Accused’s house, the Accused asked the victim if he could kiss and suck the victim’s penis. The victim eventually gave in and agreed to it. The Accused then removed the victim’s pants. Following that, the Accused proceeded to fellate the victim for about 10 minutes while the victim laid on his bed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused had caused the victim, a man under 16 years of age, to penetrate, with the victim’s penis, the Accused’s mouth, and has thereby committed an offence under Section 376A(1)(c), punishable under Section 376A(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Accused is untraced prior to the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents and submitted for a global sentence of at least 4 years’ imprisonment. Three of the relevant sentencing precedents tabled by the Prosecution are highlighted below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>PP v BAB</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19971-SSP.xml')">[2017] 1 SLR 292</a> (“<em>BAB</em>”), the Accused was biologically female but lived as a male since the age of 16. She maintained the charade of being a male by dressing like one and wearing a dildo. The victim, V, was a female minor who was 13 and 14 years old at the material time of the offences. The Accused and V became acquainted as they were neighbours and they began to develop feelings for each other, eventually engaging in sexual activities. The Accused pleaded guilty to (a) two charges under s 376A(1)(<em>b</em>) punishable under s 376A(3) of the Penal Code for penetration of V’s vagina with a dildo while V was under 14 years of age; (b) two charges under s 376A(1)(<em>b</em>) punishable under s 376A(2) for penetration of V’s vagina with a dildo while V was under 16 years of age; (c) two charges under s 376A(1)(<em>b</em>) punishable under s 376A(2) for digital penetration of V’s vagina when V was under 16 years old; and (d) one charge under s 7(<em>a</em>) of the CYPA for kissing V on the lips and licking her breasts and nipples when V was under 14 years old. In addition, the respondent gave her consent for 14 other related charges to be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Court of Appeal in <em>BAB</em> held at [65] that the starting point for sentencing involving cases of abuse of trust would be 3 years’ imprisonment for an offence under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code and 1 year’s imprisonment for an offence under s 7(a) of CYPA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In <em>AQW v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17724-SSP.xml')">[2015] 4 SLR 150</a> (“<em>AQW</em>”), the Accused was a 35 year-old male teacher who met the 14 year-old male victim online. The Accused represented himself to the victim as a 19 year-old living alone as his parents were overseas. The two began communicating and eventually the Accused invited the victim to his flat after a meal. When they proceeded to bed, they engaged in sexual activity which involved the Accused masturbating the minor and performing fellatio on him. They fell asleep. When they woke the following morning, they engaged in further sexual activity which involved the accused masturbating the minor. They had no further contact after that. The Accused was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for his offence under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code and 6 months imprisonment for his offence under s 7 of the CYPA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Sundaresh Menon CJ held in <em>AQW</em> at [50] that for offences under s 7 of the CYPA, a sentence of 6 – 8 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate where:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>a)     The sexual act that took place between offender and minor involved touching of naked genitalia;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>b)     Minor was 14 years old or above and did not appear to be particularly vulnerable;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>c)     Offender did not coerce or pressure the minor into participating in the sexual act; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>d)     There was no element of abuse of trust.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Citing <em>BAB</em>, the Prosecution submitted that <em>AQW</em> is not applicable in our present case as there was a clear element of abuse of trust involving the Accused acting as a tennis coach of the victim abusing the trust reposed on him by the victim’s parents. The Prosecution then urged this court to follow the benchmark sentences set in <em>BAB</em> for both type of offences under s 7 of CYPA and s 376A(2) of the Penal code with the starting point of 1 year and 3 years imprisonment terms respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In an unreported case of <em>PP v Kelsie Lau</em> in DAC-909079-2018 &amp; Ors (“<em>Kelsie Lau</em>”) which was decided by the District Court after the case of <em>BAB</em>, the benchmark sentences set in <em>AQW</em> were distinguished on the ground that there was an element of abuse of trust involved. In <em>Kelsie Lau</em> the Prosecution proceeded against the Accused on 2 counts under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code, 1 count under s 7(a) CYPA and 1 count under s 7(b) CYPA. There were 5 counts under s 7 CYPA taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Accused, <em>Kelsie Lau</em> (F/29) was the victim’s mathematics teacher. They began texting and grew closer and entered into a romantic relationship when he was 15 years old. They would go for jobs, watch movies, sit at parks to engage in physical intimacy, and exchange sexually explicit text messages. They had a “honeymoon” at a hotel for 5 days during the school holidays. The Accused pleaded guilty to 4 offences committed during this stay:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>a)     2 counts under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code for asking the victim to place his finger on a specific spot on her naked vaginal area and move it in an up-and-down motion, then insert his finger into her vagina; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>b)     2 counts under s 7 CYPA for rubbing the victim’s bare penis with her hands and for procuring the victim to lick her vagina</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After considering the case of <em>BAB</em> cited by the Prosecution, the learned District Judge in <em>Kelsie Lau</em>, sentenced her to 2 years’ imprisonment each for the offences under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code and 9 months’ imprisonment each for the s 7 CYPA offences, and ordered one sentence for s 376A(2) of the Penal Code to run consecutively with one sentence of s 7 CYPA to give a global sentence of 33 months imprisonment term.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Prosecution sought to distinguish the case of <em>Kelsie Lau</em> from this present case on the ground that <em>Kelsie Lau</em> was a case where both the Accused and victim were in a romantic relationship and that the period of the offences were committed over 5 days.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Defence Counsel submitted that Accused suffered from Avoidant Personality Disorder and Persistent Depressive Disorder at the material time of the offences. Although the psychiatrist did not explicitly state that Accused’s medical condition had a causal or contributory link to the commission of the offences, the Defence Counsel urged this court to consider that the Accused’s psychiatric conditions did somehow diminish his culpability in the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Defence Counsel also indicated that the Accused was under a mistaken belief that he was in a relationship with the victim. There was no coercion or pressure by the Accused. The Accused is a first offender who was remorseful and cooperated with the police during the investigation. He has been undergoing counselling and the medical reports have indicated that there is a low risk of him re-offending. His plea of guilt has saved the court’s time and spared the victim from testifying in court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Defence Counsel urged this court to follow the benchmark sentences set in <em>AQW</em> on the basis that there was no abuse of trust in this case and submitted for this court to impose a global sentence of 16 months imprisonment consisting of 10 months imprisonment for the s 376A(2) Penal Code offence to run consecutively with 6 months imprisonment for the s 7 CYPA offence. The Defence Counsel also argued that <em>Kelsie Lau</em> is more aggravating as she faced 2 counts under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code compared to the present Accused who faced only one count under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Court’s Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The dominant sentencing consideration for offenders who are mature adults involved in procuring the commission of an obscene act by a young person under s 7 of CYPA and in causing a minor to sexually penetrate any stipulated body part of the offender under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code should be one of deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In <em>BAB</em> at [61] – [62], the Court of Appeal referred to <em>AQW</em> and held that the benchmark sentences in <em>AQW</em> did not apply on the facts of <em>BAB</em> where there was a clear case of abuse of trust involved. In our current case there was also an abuse of trust as the Accused was a tennis coach engaged by the victim’s school to coach the victim and other students on tennis lessons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The abuse of trust is a significant aggravating factor for consideration in arriving at the starting points of the benchmark sentences indicated in <em>BAB</em>. At [65] of <em>BAB</em>, the Court of Appeal, however, suggested that the starting points for the sentences are merely indicative sentences, having regard to the gravity of the offence, the applicable sentencing range and the factor of abuse. The court ought to take into consideration also elements of proportionality and the mitigating factors in arriving at the eventual appropriate sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In <em>BAB</em> there was a lengthy period of deception practised by the offender whereby she committed the numerous offences over a period of at least 20 months with at least 4 counts under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code proceeded with by the Prosecution. In the present case, there was no element of deception and fewer offences were committed by the Accused over a period of about 10 months with only one count under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code and the remaining counts under s 7 of the CYPA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In my view, the level of abuse of trust were far more blatant and egregious in <em>BAB</em>, who was the caregiver entrusted to take care of the victim and in <em>Kelsie Lau</em>, who was the victim’s teacher entrusted with the role of a nurturer and educator looking after the victim’s welfare in school as compared to the present Accused, who was engaged as a freelance tennis coach by the school.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I accept that the present Accused may be under a mistaken belief that he was in a relationship with the victim and there was an absence of a genuine romantic relationship shown in <em>BAB</em> and <em>Kelsie Lau</em>. However, this must be considered in the light that in both <em>BAB</em> and <em>Kelsie Lau</em> the Prosecution proceeded on four and two counts under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code respectively as opposed to only one count under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code committed by the present Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I did not give much weight to the psychiatric conditions of the present Accused as diminishing his culpability as there were no explicit explanations in the medical reports accounting for how the Accused become deprived of his control resulting in the sexual exploitation of the victim by him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As for the other mitigating factors cited by the Defence Counsel relating to consent, lack of coercion, remorse, cooperation with the police, low risk of re-offending and the plea of guilt thus sparing the victim from testifying in court – all these factors are similarly present in <em>BAB</em> and <em>Kelsie Lau</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Having considered the gravity of the offences committed and both the aggravating and mitigating factors of this case in light of both <em>BAB</em> and <em>Kelsie Lau</em>, I am not persuaded by the Prosecution that on the facts of this case that this court ought to sentence Accused more than what was meted out to <em>Kelsie Lau</em> and to follow the benchmark starting points indicated in <em>BAB</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the circumstances, I sentenced the Accused to 24 months for the s 376A(2) Penal Code offence and 9 months each for the s 7 CYPA offences and ordered a global sentence of 33 months imprisonment with one of the sentences under s 7 of CYPA to run consecutively with the sentence of s 376A(2) Penal Code offence.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap9 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
