class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused, Loi Chye Heng, a 63 year old resident at the Bukit Batok Home for the Aged (“the Accused”), pleaded guilty before me to one charge under section 323A of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) read with section 74A(2) PC. The Accused was charged for using his walking stick to hit one Nung Ah Sai, a 86 year old fellow resident of the Home who suffers from mild mental retardation and is partially deaf/mute and minimally communicative (“the Victim”). As a result of the Accused’s attack, the Victim sustained lacerations on both of his calves such that he was unable to bear weight from 8 December 2020 to 12 January 2021 and was thereby unable to pursue his ordinary pursuits during the space of more than 20 days.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Having considered the submissions of the parties, I imposed a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment. I now set out the brief reasons for my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. The SOF is reproduced below: -</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The accused is Loi Chye Heng, a 63-year-old Male Singaporean bearing NRIC No: XXX (D.O.B.: 22 June 1957). He is a resident of Bukit Batok Home for the Aged (“the Home”) located at No 11 Bukit Batok West Avenue 2, Singapore. He was admitted to the Home under Section 5 of the Destitute Persons Act (Cap 78, 2013 Rev Ed) (“Destitute Persons Act”) on 15 August 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The complainant is Abu Bakar bin Yusof (“Abu Bakar”), a 58-year-old Male. He is a Senior Care Worker at the Home.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The victim is Nung Ah Sai, Male, an 86-year-old Singaporean. He is also a resident of the Home.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The victim was admitted to the Home on 9 February 2011 under the provisions of the Destitute Persons Act. The report dated 30 December 2020 prepared by Salai Win Swe, the Head of Nursing and Therapy at the Home, states that the victim suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, bilateral cataracts, NCNC anaemia. Further, the victim is diagnosed with mild mental retardation and is partially deaf/ mute, and minimally communicative. The memo from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) dated 6 July 2011 states that the victim was first seen by IMH in 1992 and found to be functioning in the mildly retarded range of intelligence with an approximate IQ of 60.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The witness is Koh Kok Seng (“Kok Seng”), a 54-year-old Male. He is a fellow resident of the Home.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    On 8 December 2020 at about 5.36pm, Abu Bakar called “999” with the text message “One resident whack the other with walking stick. One injured”. The incident location given was the Home.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Investigations revealed that on 8 December 2020 at about 4.30pm, the accused finished his dinner and returned to his room to have a shower. After his shower, the accused hung up his towel to dry in his room and then left his room. Shortly after, the victim went into one of the rooms and took a towel to wipe his buttocks. Kok Seng was nearby and observed the victim doing so.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    As the accused was walking back to his room, Kok Seng told the accused that the victim had taken his towel. The accused got angry with the victim, as the victim had also taken his towel a few months ago. After the previous incident when the victim had taken his towel, the accused had complained to the staff in the Home that the victim used the accused’s towel to wipe his buttocks but the staff told him to ignore the victim as he is of low IQ.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    At around 4.50pm, when the victim walked past the accused along the common corridor, the accused, who walks with the aid of a walking stick, raised his walking stick and hit the victim’s calves a few times, causing him lacerations on his calves. The victim walked away to the main office of the Home. Abu Bakar, who was at the main office, noticed that the victim was bleeding and quickly called the police.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    The victim was subsequently conveyed to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (“NTFGH”) at around 7.48pm. Two medical reports, one dated 16 December 2020 prepared by Dr Lee Wei Liang, Luke and another dated 28 January 2021 prepared by Dr Joel Tan, detailed the victim’s injuries, subsequent treatment and recovery.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    The victim was found to have suffered the following injuries (as shown in a photograph of his calves taken after the assault at Annex A):</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    Left calf laceration (stellate laceration, about 6cm by 4cm, with muscle and subcutaneous fat exposed); and</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    Right calf laceration (horizontal laceration, about 4cm, with subcutaneous fat exposed).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    X-rays of the victim’s bilateral tibia/fibula did not reveal any obvious fractures or dislocation. He was given antibiotics and a tetanus vaccination. On 10 December 2020, the victim underwent bilateral calf wound debridement and closure of left leg with negative pressure therapy dressing (a suction machine that clears up the contents of the wound and covers it with a foam layer) to right leg. Later on 12 December 2020, the victim underwent right lower limb wound debridement and application of negative pressure dressing and left lower limb dressing. He finally underwent relook debridement of right lower limb and split skin grafting on 20 December 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    He was admitted to the general ward under the Orthopaedic Surgery Department at NTFGH for further management, then transferred to Jurong Community Hospital on 21 December 2020 for further rehabilitation while awaiting wound healing and for skin graft to take. He also had to undergo regular dressing change. On 8 January 2021, he was admitted to All Saints Home Tampines. He is dually incontinent on diapers and requires assistance by the nurses in his activities of daily living, which include feeding, showering etc.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    From 8 December 2020 to 12 January 2021 (a period of 35 days), the victim required temporary non-weight bearing on his right leg to protect his skin graft. As of 13 January 2021, Dr Joel Tan has assessed that the victim is able to weight bear as tolerated as his skin graft has healed. However, the victim currently relies on a wheelchair to move around whilst residing at All Saints Home Tampines.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    The victim suffers mild mental retardation and is partially deaf/ mute, and minimally communicative. By reason of his mental and physical disability, the victim is substantially unable to protect himself from abuse, and therefore qualifies as a vulnerable person under s 74A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). At the time of the offence, the accused knew that the victim was a vulnerable person.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    By hitting the victim’s calves with his walking stick, the accused caused the victim to sustain lacerations on both his calves and be unable to walk and therefore unable to follow his ordinary pursuits during a space of more than 20 days. The accused thereby voluntarily caused hurt, which hurt he intended to cause is not grievous, but the hurt which he actually caused is grievous, and has committed an offence under s 323A read with s 74A(2) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prescribed Penalties</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Under section 323A PC, whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself likely to cause is not grievous but the hurt which he actually causes is grievous, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine which may extend to $10,000, or with both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       With the recent introduction of section 74A PC, the court may sentence the offender to punishment not exceeding twice the maximum punishment that the court could, but for section 74A PC, impose for the offence, if at the time of committing the offence the offender knew or ought reasonably to have known that the victim was a vulnerable person.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Accused is traced for a number of drug-related antecedents dating back to the 1970s to early 2000. More recent are the Accused’s convictions on 2 August 2004 for criminal intimidation as well as on 8 August 2005 for theft-in-dwelling and breach of a personal protection order.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Prosecution proposed a sentencing framework for section 323A PC offences that is modelled after the two-step sentencing approach laid down by the High Court in <em>Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23956-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 526</a> and <em>Public Prosecutor v BDB</em> [2018] 1 SLR 1267 for section 323 PC offences (i.e. voluntarily causing hurt) and section 325 PC offences (i.e. voluntarily causing grievous hurt) respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the first step, an indicative starting sentence should be determined based on the seriousness of the grievous hurt caused. The Prosecution proposes the following three sentencing bands: -</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="12.1775644871026%"/> <col width="55.7888422315537%"/> <col width="32.0335932813437%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Band</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Hurt caused</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Indicative sentencing range</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Low harm:</b> being unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for at least 20 days</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or custodial term up to 10 weeks</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Moderate harm:</b> simple fractures or dislocation of bone</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 10 weeks’ to</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Serious harm:</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitates significant surgical procedures (e.g. multiple fractures)</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Hurt which endangers life or causes the sufferer to be in severe bodily pain over at least 20 days</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Permanent disfiguration of head or face</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Permanent disability/privation of sight, hearing or destruction of powers of joint, emasculation</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">- Death (starting point of 48 months’ imprisonment)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 15 to 48 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the second step, an assessment of the accused’s culpability and any aggravating and mitigating factors is undertaken. The necessary upward or downward adjustments are then made to the indicative starting sentence derived at the first step of the analysis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     According to this proposed framework, the Prosecution submits that the injuries suffered by the Victim fell under Band 2 (i.e. moderate harm) and that a starting point of about three to four months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the second step of the analysis, the Prosecution submits that an uplift of five to eight months’ imprisonment would be appropriate, considering that: -</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Victim was a vulnerable person under section 74A PC. At the time of the offence, the Accused was aware that the Victim was of low IQ.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused had used a weapon (i.e. his walking stick) to attack the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Accused’s previous convictions for criminal intimidation in 2004 and for the breach of a personal protection order in 2005 were relevant antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Prosecution has also tendered a table of precedents detailing the sentences that were meted out to offenders who were charged under section 323 PC read with section 74A PC for voluntarily causing hurt to a vulnerable person (“the Prosecution’s cited precedents”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Prosecution acknowledges that the Accused, unlike the offenders in the Prosecution’s cited precedents, was not performing the role of a caretaker. However, the Prosecution submits that the main aggravating factor in the present case would be the gravity of the Victim’s injuries which were much more serious than those suffered by the victims in the Prosecution’s cited precedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After accounting for the said uplift, the Prosecution ultimately submits that eight to twelve months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Counsel for the Accused submitted that a sentence of between three to four months’ imprisonment was appropriate. Counsel urged the Court to consider the Victim’s “relatively mild injuries” as well as the following mitigating factors: -</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused’s timely plea of guilt;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused’s cooperation with the relevant investigating authorities; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Accused’s remorse and regret for his actions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Counsel for the Accused also tendered a table of precedents detailing the sentences imposed for offenders charged under section 323 PC read with section 34 PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I have considered the precedents cited by the Accused’s counsel in support of their submission for a three to four months’ imprisonment term. However, I did not find them useful as they were quite dated and more importantly, related to a lesser offence under section 323 PC.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Instead, in assessing the severity of the Victim’s injuries, I had regard to the sentencing precedents for section 323A PC offences. Given the recent introduction of section 323A PC, there were only five precedents available and these are summarised below: -</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)      <b><em>PP v Muhammad Syafiq Bin Muhammad Ashrai </em></b> <b>(SC-904120-2019):</b> The victim had initially tailed the accused’s sister’s (Syafiqa) car as he wanted to confront her about her inconsiderate behaviour. Upon realising that the victim was tailing her, Syafiqa called for help and the accused arrived together with two other persons. The accused threw a filled water bottle at the victim’s eye forcefully at close distance. The victim suffered a permanent privation of sight in his left eye thereafter. In particular, the victim suffered (a) left gross hyphaemia; (b) traumatic sphincter rupture with pupil dilation; (c) acute glaucoma due to angle damage and hyphaemia; and (d) increased risk of cataract formation. The victim was hospitalised for nine days and required long-term follow up and possibly surgery in the future. The victim continued to suffer from glares, blurred vision, and strain leading to headaches in his left eye. The accused was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)      <b><em>PP v Muhammad Zulfiqah Bin Khairul Anwar </em></b> <b>(SC-904120-2019):</b> The accused and the victim met up at a void deck to resolve their disputes. Both parties exchanged punches with one another. Even though the victim fell to the floor, the accused continued to punch the victim on his face and head several times before the victim’s fiancé intervened. The victim suffered from (a) scalp laceration; (b) left orbital floor fracture; and (c) right shoulder contusion. The victim was given 7 days of outpatient medical leave. The accused was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)      <b><em>PP v Satpal Singh s/o Jaswant Singh </em></b> <b>(SC-904119-2020):</b> Angered that his mother refused to lend him any money and instead encouraged him to look for a job, the accused punched his mother once in the right thigh area. The force of the punch caused the victim to fall to the ground and land on her right thigh. As a result, the victim sustained a right femoral shaft fracture and had to undergo intramedullary nailing for the said fracture. The victim was hospitalised for eight days and was given medical leave from 7 February 2020 to 13 March 2020. The accused was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)      <b><em>PP v Chan Chye Chuan </em></b> <b>(SC</b>-<b>907253-2020):</b> At a coffeeshop, the accused intervened in a dispute between his friend and the victim. The accused’s initial attempts to de-escalate the matter was unsuccessful and the accused eventually challenged the victim to a one-on-one fight. The accused pushed the victim’s chest with both hands causing him to fall. After the victim got up, the accused pushed the victim’s chest again causing him to fall a second time. The victim sustained a left 10<sup>th</sup> posterior rib fracture and was hospitalised for three days. The victim’s fracture was managed conservatively, and the victim was discharged with 11 days’ hospitalisation leave. The victim declined orthopaedic surgery review. The accused was sentenced to 16 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)      <b><em>PP v Tan Kim Liang </em></b> <b>(SC-901049-2021):</b> The accused was charged under section 323A PC read with section 74D PC for attacking his 77 year old mother after she had asked him to look for a job. The accused had pushed the victim causing her to fall backwards and to the ground. He further pushed her back to the ground each time she tried to get up. The victim sustained a 2-cm laceration on her jaw which had to be sutured. The victim also sustained an undisplaced fracture of the anterior column of the left acetabulum, left inferior pubic rami, right superior and inferior pubic rami and anterior column of the right acetabulum. The medical opinion was that the complete recovery would take three to six months. The accused was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I am unable to agree with the counsel for the Accused that the Victim’s injuries were “relatively mild”. The lacerations on the Victim’s calves were deep which resulted in the exposure of subcutaneous fat and muscle. According to the medical report dated 16 December 2020 prepared by Dr Lee Wei Liang, Luke, the lacerations measured 6 cm x 4 cm on the Victim’s left calf and about 4 cm on his right calf. Dr Joel Tan, in his medical report dated 28 January 2021(“Dr Joel Tan’s report”), noted that there was “a deep L-shaped laceration” with “visible partially cut muscle” on the Victim’s right posterior calf.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is also clear from the photograph tendered by the Prosecution of the Victim’s bleeding calves that the lacerations were no shallow wounds: -</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0090_Image/[2021] SGDC 0090_image1.png" style="height:245.339083333333pt;width:332.826513888889pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     To treat the Victim’s injuries, the Victim had to be admitted to the general ward under Ng Teng Fong General Hospital’s Orthopaedic Surgery Department. Thereat, the Victim had to undergo several medical procedures which had to be conducted over three different days. As detailed in Dr Joel Tan’s report, the Victim underwent: -</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Bilateral calf wound debridement and closure of left leg with negative pressure therapy dressing to right leg on 10 December 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Right lower limb wound debridement and application of negative pressure dressing and left lower limb dressing on 12 December 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Relook debridement of right lower limb and split skin grafting on 20 December 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Post-procedure, the Victim could not be discharged immediately but instead had to be transferred to Jurong Community Hospital on 21 December 2020 for further rehabilitation while waiting for the skin graft to heal. As the Victim was only able to weight bear as tolerated on 13 January 2021, the injuries suffered had left the Victim unable to walk for a considerable period of 35 days between 8 December 2020 and 12 January 2021 during which he had to be assisted by nurses in his activities of daily living. I further note that even as at the date of Dr Joel Tan’s report (i.e. 28 January 2021), the Victim was still staying in Jurong Community Hospital undergoing physiotherapy and regular dressing change. Finally, as stated in the SOF, I note that the Victim currently relies on a wheelchair to move around.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In my judgment, the extent of pain and suffering suffered by the Victim and the long period of recovery are not to be trivialised. I accept the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework and agree that four months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate starting sentence having regard to the severity of the Victim’s injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For completeness, I am mindful that similar sentences were imposed in two of the section 323A PC precedents discussed above involving fractures. In particular, three months’ imprisonment was imposed in <em>PP v Muhammad Zulfiqah Bin Khairul Anwar</em> which involved a left orbital floor <em>fracture</em>, and four months’ imprisonment was imposed in <em>PP v Chan Chye Chuan</em> which involved a left 10<sup>th</sup> posterior rib <em>fracture</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, while fractures are generally considered more severe than surface wounds like lacerations, the relevant fractures in these cases do not appear to be serious considering that they did not necessitate any surgery or other forms of medical procedure. The medical leave granted in these cases were also relatively short (i.e. seven days in <em>PP v Muhammad Zulfiqah Bin Khairul Anwar</em> and 11 days in <em>PP v Chan Chye Chuan</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I now turn to consider the Accused’s culpability and the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Victim is clearly a vulnerable person within meaning of section 74A(5) PC by reason of his advanced age and his mild mental retardation. Despite being aware that the Victim was of low IQ, the Accused struck the Victim using a weapon no less. A stiff sentence must be meted out to signal society’s and the court’s disapprobation of offences committed against vulnerable persons who are substantially unable to protect themselves.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     That said, I am also mindful that the eventual sentence must not be disproportionate to the overall criminality presented by the Accused. While I agree with the Prosecution that an upward adjustment to the starting sentence is warranted, an uplift of five to eight months’ imprisonment as sought would be excessive for the following reasons: -</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Accused did not occupy a position of trust and responsibility <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Victim. This is in contrast to the offenders in the Prosecution’s cited precedents who were caretakers of the victims therein and who had, by their actions, breached the trust and responsibility reposed in them.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Accused’s attack on the victim was a one-off incident. The Accused did not abuse the Victim over an extended duration as seen in the Prosecution’s cited precedents. In particular, in <em>PP v Zulkefly Bin Yusof</em>, the accused had assaulted the victim over a period of 10 days. And in <em>PP v Eis Atikah</em>, the abuse took place over a period of one month.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As I have noted above, the Prosecution acknowledges that the Accused assumed no responsibility over the care of the Victim. Instead, the Prosecution argues that the “main aggravating factor” would be the gravity of the injuries suffered by the Victim which were much more serious than those suffered by the victims in the Prosecution’s cited precedents. I am however unable to agree with this argument for the simple reason that the severity of the Victim’s injuries has already been considered in the first step of the analysis in determining the appropriate starting sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In my judgment, an uplift of four months’ imprisonment to a total sentence of eight months’ imprisonment would adequately reflect the Accused’s criminality in the circumstances of this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In arriving at my decision on sentence, I have given the appropriate weight to the mitigating factors cited by the counsel for the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     For the reasons above, I am of the view that a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment is appropriate. The Accused’s sentence is backdated to the date of his remand i.e. 10 December 2020.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Annex A of the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap6 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
