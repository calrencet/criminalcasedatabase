There was a police roadblock along Crawford Street. The accused, a 26-year-old Singaporean male, who was driving his motorcar no. SLJ1107A (“the accused’s motorcar”) saw the roadblock. He stopped his motorcar at about 50m before the “Police Stop” sign at the roadblock and in a dramatic fashion, he decided to make a three-point turn to evade the roadblock.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In a bid to escape, the accused travelled against the flow of traffic for a distance of at least 140m from Crawford Street to Beach Road. The Traffic Police officers on duty at the roadblock gave chase. The accused was eventually stopped by the Traffic Police along the service road carpark at Block 1 Beach. Road. That was not the end. When the accused was stopped, he was observed to reek of alcohol. A breathalyser test was administered on the accused and the result showed “fail”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The accused was arrested at the scene. The Breath Analysing Device (“BAD”) test conducted at the Traffic Police Headquarters revealed that the proportion of alcohol in the accused’s breath was 46 µg of alcohol per 100ml of breath, which was above the prescribed limit of 35µg of alcohol per 100ml of breath.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As a consequence of the accused’s actions, the accused was charged with the offences of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) read with s 67(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”) as well as dangerous driving under section 64(1) punishable under s 64(2C)(a) read with s 64(2C)(c) and s 64(2D)(i) of the RTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 30 October 2020, the accused pleaded guilty before me to both the drink driving and dangerous driving charges.

A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offences of drink driving and dangerous driving charges reads as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    On the 11th day of February 2020, at about 4.05 a.m., the complainant spotted the accused driving motorcar SLJ1107A along Crawford Street towards Lavender Street near Beach Road, Singapore, on a road recklessly, having regard to all the circumstances of the cases, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time on the road, by failing to obey to traffic indicating sign and drive against the flow of traffic from Crawford Street to Beach Road for an estimated distance of about 140 metres. The accused was stopped by the complainant for checks. On stopping, the complainant interviewed the accused and observed he reeked of alcohol. The complainant administered a breathalyzer test on the accused and the result shown is ‘Fail’. The accused was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and he was escorted to Traffic Police for Breath Analyzing Device (BAD) test.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    The BAD test was conducted by Senior Staff Sergeant Ismail Saheeb on the 11th day of February 2020 at about 5.20 a.m. at Traffic Police. The breath test revealed that the proportion of alcohol in accused’s breath was 46 microgrammes of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of breath. The prescribed limit is 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    Investigations revealed that on the 11th day of February 2020 at about 2.30 a.m., the accused was at a club called ‘Empire’ located at Orchard Plaza. While the accused was there, he had consumed about two glasses of ‘Martel’ beer at about 2.35 a.m. The accused left the location at about 3.15 a.m. and he was driving his car heading to Kim Keat Road. While the accused was driving along Crawford Street towards Lavender Street, he saw a police’s roadblock set up along the location. The accused stopped at about 50 metres before the “Police stop” signage and made a 3 point-turn. The accused then travelled against the flow of traffic for an estimated distance of about 140 metres from Crawford Street to Beach Road and was subsequently stopped by the complainant along the service road car park of Block 1 Beach Road.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     A sketch plan of the scene of offence as well as a map of the path taken by the accused’s motorcar as produced by the Prosecution are as follows:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0019_Image/[2021] SGDC 0019_image1.png" style="height:217.6893125pt;width:202.718201388889pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The accused was untraced for any previous traffic convictions. He had one compounded offence for failing to conform to the traffic red light signal on 29 June 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The accused confirmed his antecedents to be correct.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Prosecution orally submitted for a custodial sentence of at least four weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for a period of at least three years for each charge with the sentences for both charges to run concurrently.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Prosecution first highlighted that as the dangerous driving charge arose as a consequence of drink driving, the accused was considered as a “serious offender” pursuant to s 64(2C)(c) read with s 64(8) of the RTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Next, the Prosecution submitted that whilst harm caused in this case was slight in that no actual harm was caused to any person or property, the accused’s culpability was high. This was despite the fact that the accused’s alcohol level at the material time was low in band 1 at 46µg/100ml of breath based on the alcohol banding as set out in the seminal decision of <em>Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0194.xml')">[2013] SGHC 194</a> (<em>“Edwin Suse”</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The reason for this was that there was a deliberate manner of reckless driving on the part of the accused when he intentionally stopped at a distance of about 50m before the roadblock and made a three-point turn to drive against the flow of traffic to evade the roadblock. He made a concerted effort to drive against the flow of traffic from Crawford Street, rounded the bend to Beach Road at a slip road where there was a pedestrian crossing. This bend was a blind spot for vehicles to observe any pedestrians using the zebra crossing. Furthermore, it gave little or no warning to any oncoming traffic to avoid a head-on collision with the accused’s motorcar.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Furthermore, the accused continued to travel along Breach Road for about 140m before he was eventually stopped by the Traffic Police. This was the extent of risk the accused took to evade the roadblock. It took the prompt action of the Traffic Police to give chase and capture the accused in time to deter him from a successful escape.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Potential harm caused was also great despite the fact that it was about 4.05am in the morning. Both pedestrians who could have used the zebra crossing as well as any oncoming vehicles might not have been able to look out for the accused coming their way in the opposite direction to avoid an accident given that it was still dark at that time. It was fortuitous that nobody was hurt due to this incident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Given the manner and circumstances of the accused’s driving, custodial threshold was clearly crossed in the present case based on the framework as set out in the High Court’s decision of <em>Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21213-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 755</a> <em>(“Stansilas”)</em>, which was decided under the previous s 67(1)(b) of the RTA provision prior to the new RTA amendments on 1 November 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Additionally, the Prosecution emphasised that in the Parliamentary debates for the Second Reading of the RTA amendments, a key focus was on drink driving, which was a common problem where such drivers show a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users. These drivers were one of the biggest contributors to serious accidents on the roads. In fact, it was legislative intent for offenders of drink driving to face stiffer penalties to signal the aggravated seriousness of such an action.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Where an offender commits an act of dangerous or careless driving as well as drink driving, it was Parliamentary intention that there would be additional penalties and disqualification (“DQ”) periods being imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On the facts here and with the new s 67(1)(b) as well as s 64(2C)(a) read with s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA where the criminal penalties have increased, Prosecution was of the position that there was an unequivocal heightened need for both general and specific deterrence to send a strong signal to discourage like-minded citizens from emulating the accused’s actions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In summary, given the accused’s high culpability, low degree of harm caused and great potential harm that could have been caused, Prosecution was of the view that a global custodial sentence of at least four weeks’ imprisonment and a lengthy DQ period of at least three years was warranted.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Defence, on the other hand, submitted two alternative sentences:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     A fine of not more than $2,000 to $4,000 for the drink driving charge and a Short Detention Order for a period of not more than five days with a Community Service Order for 150 hours of community service for the dangerous driving charge; or</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     A fine of not more than $2,000 to $4,000 for the drink driving charge and an imprisonment term for not more than five days and a fine of $2,000 for the dangerous driving charge (i.e. a global sentence of $4,000 to $6,000 fine and five days’ imprisonment).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In either sentence, the Defence submitted that the accused was prepared to accept a global DQ period of three years.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In support of its submissions, the Defence tendered a written mitigation on behalf of the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In terms of the accused’s personal circumstances for drinking prior to him committing the offences on the fateful day in question, the Defence informed the court that the accused was drinking alone at a club at Orchard Plaza because he had found out that his girlfriend was cheating on him. Although he had driven to a club called “Empire”, he did not intend to drink heavily. He drank two glasses of “Martel” beer in the course of that night.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At about 3.15am, the accused decided to drive his motorcar out of Orchard Plaza even though he was mildly intoxicated. Whilst he was driving along Crawford Street towards Lavender Street, the accused spotted the police roadblock ahead. Due to a poor judgment call and in his moment of panic and desperation, the accused decided to make a U-turn and drive against the flow of traffic from the police roadblock as the roads were empty at that time. He did not speed in an attempt to avoid the roadblock. The accused stopped his motorcar when the Traffic Police officers caught up with him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Despite his transgression, the Defence said that the accused was extremely remorseful for his action. The accused understood that what he did was wrong and that his personal problems should not be an excuse for his reckless behaviour. He had cooperated fully with the police with investigations since he was arrested.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This was the accused’s first brush with the law. As he has always been a law-abiding citizen, the accused was therefore eager to make up for his mistake. He hoped for a second change to contribute meaningfully to the society and be a good citizen.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Moreover, the accused was raised in a patriotic family. His father was a sergeant major during his days in the army despite the fact that he only had a PSLE qualification. The accused’s brother is currently in the Special Forces unit and is also one of the youngest sergeant majors in the army.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The accused, himself, was recommended by former Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Amrin Amin, to join the Singapore Civil Defence Force as a Senior Officer. However, this did not materialise as the accused suffers from hereditary colour blindness. Despite this setback, the accused volunteered for SG Secure in 2018 under Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC to raise awareness of the importance of safety and security in Singapore within the neighbourhood.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The accused further played his part by donating regularly to charities such as the Bone Marrow Donor Programme.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In early 2020, the accused started a small start-up marketing business to help Small and Medium Enterprises (“SME”) to grow their presence online. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this has caused his small business to have a rough start. Despite the difficulties, the accused and his business partner soldiered on and he has even hired a few office staff to mitigate the growing unemployment crisis in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the above reasons, the Defence argued that the accused is a good citizen and possesses a high potential for rehabilitation. He can contribute positively towards the society.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Consequently, the Defence submitted that the court should consider a Community-Based Sentence (“CBS”) in respect of the dangerous driving charge for the present case. This would be by way of a combination of a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) for a period of not more than five days and a Community Service Order (“CSO”) for 150 hours of community work. The Defence was of the view that this would strike an appropriate balance between the need for general deterrence and rehabilitation in the circumstances, particularly given the accused’s ability to re-integrate with the society and need to maintain a good reputation in his professional life.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Defence cited the High Court’s decision of <em>Sim Wen Yi Ernest v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19333-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 174</a> (<em>“Ernest Sim”</em>) for the proposition that an SDO is suitable for situations where the courts find that the threshold for imposing a custodial sentence has been crossed due to the nature of the offence but the offender possesses the necessary characteristics and support for immediate re-integration into society. This included accused who were not only youthful offenders but those over the age of 21 years old.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Ernest Sim</em>, the accused was 26 years old at the time of the offence. The High Court allowed the accused’s appeal against a sentence of 7 weeks’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt using an airsoft gun under s 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). Instead, the High Court sentenced him to an SDO for a period of five days and a CSO of 150 hours. This was because the accused was not beyond redemption and was someone who had a good future and could benefit from a second chance to put his life right: at [43].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Considering the accused’s high potential for rehabilitation, strong familial support for immediate re-integration into society and his relative youth at the material time of the offence, the Defence strongly urged the court to impose the SDO plus CSO. Moreover, the SDO provides the relevant deterrence as an offender must still endure all the rigors associated with prison life. Critically, the SDO takes away the stigmatisation from an offender as under s 7DA of the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap 268), his criminal record is rendered spent upon completion of a community sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I informed Defence counsel that given the nature and seriousness of the offences, I was of the view that a CBS was unlikely to be an appropriate sentence in the circumstances. This was despite the fact that s 337(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”) does not impose any restrictions that would prevent me from imposing such a sentence for a first drink driving offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Defence then proceeded with its alternative submission for a sentence of not more than five days’ imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 for the dangerous driving charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Regardless, the Defence was pressing for only a fine to be imposed for the drink driving charge. This was because, the Defence was of the view that a sentence to a fine is the typical sentence for a first offender under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA unless there are egregious or aggravating circumstances that warrants a custodial sentence. It relied on <em>Edwin Suse</em> as well as the sentencing benchmarks as enunciated at [22] of that decision, where the range of fines and DQ periods were categorised according to the level of alcohol detected in an offender’s breath at the material time as follows:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="34.12%"/> <col width="24.46%"/> <col width="41.42%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Level of alcohol</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>(μg per 100 ml of breath)</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Range of fines</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Range of disqualification</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">35 – 54 </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,000 – $2,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 – 18 months</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">55 – 69</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000 –$3,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 – 24 months</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">70 – 89</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$3,000 – $4,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24 – 36 months</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> ≥ 90</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&gt; $ 4,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36 – 48 months (or longer)</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Since the amendments to the RTA on 1 November 2019, the Defence highlighted that the penalties relating to first offenders for drink driving has doubled from a fine of between $1,000 and $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months to a fine between $2,000 and $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months. Save for special reasons, the mandatory minimum period of DQ was also raised from 12 months to two years.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     By calibrating the sentencing benchmarks as set out in <em>Edwin Suse</em> upwards to take into account the RTA amendments, the Defence submitted that the appropriate starting point sentence in the present case for band 1 alcohol level of between 35 to 54 µg/100ml of breath would be a fine of between $2,000 to $4,000 and a DQ period of 24 to 36 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As the accused’s alcohol level was in band 1 and at the lower end of the range, the Defence submitted that a fine amount of $2,000 was appropriate. Since no harm or damage was caused, custodial threshold was not crossed for this particular charge. Any aggravating factor arising from the accused’s act of driving against the flow of traffic should only be considered under the dangerous driving charge instead.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As for dangerous driving, the Defence submitted that the maximum penalty for first offenders under s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA where no hurt resulted remains the same as that under the previous s 64(1) of the RTA, i.e. a fine not exceeding $5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Thus, this was a clear indication that Parliament only intended for sentencing norms to be raised in respect of egregious cases of irresponsible driving, particularly those that result in death or serious injury.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Where an accident or an act of dangerous driving arises from drink driving, an offender is further considered a “serious offender” and hence liable to an additional penalty under s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA, i.e. to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. This penalty is in addition to any punishment imposed under s 64(2C)(a) or s 64(2C)(b) of the RTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Accordingly, the Defence proposed a two-stage sentencing approach in respect of an accused who is punishable under s 64(2C)(a) as well as s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA as a serious offender as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     First stage: Identify the appropriate sentence to impose under s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA by taking reference from pre-RTA amendment precedent cases to determine the seriousness of the offence committed based on the long established parameters of harm caused by the offence and the accused’s culpability as set out in <em>Koh Thiam Huat v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20403-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 123</a> (“<em>Koh Thiam Huat”</em>) at [41]; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second stage: Apply a suitable uplift in the sentence to impose under s64(2C)(c) of the RTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     For the first stage, the Defence cited the following dangerous driving cases under the previous s 64(1) RTA:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col

The harm caused by the offence of dangerous driving in <em>Koh Thiam Huat</em> as well as <em>Teoh Wei Keat</em> were also more serious since injuries were caused to the victims in those two cases, but no harm was caused in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As for the potential harm that might have resulted, the Defence argued that this was far greater in both <em>Brandon Ng</em> and <em>Chan Choon Seng</em> than the present case. In <em>Brandon Ng</em>, the accused had driven against the flow of traffic after drink alcohol for 2km along a busy expressway and caused at least four vehicles to take evasive action. In <em>Chan Choon Seng</em>, the accused had sped away from the Traffic Police at a high speed of 160 to 170kmph along a busy expressway.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Therefore, the Defence argued that by comparing with the precedents, the accused’s culpability was moderate. There was no harm caused and potential harm was low to moderate. The accused had only driven about 300m along an empty road. He did not speed and did not cause any actual danger to other road users. In the circumstances, the Defence submitted that the appropriate sentence for the accused here should be a custodial sentence of no more than five days’ imprisonment for the dangerous driving charge pursuant to s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Defence pointed out that at the first stage, the accused’s drink driving behaviour should not be taken as an aggravating factor against him. Otherwise this would result in double-counting during the second stage.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Coming to the second stage for the punishment under s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA, where the accused is being punished as a serious offender for committing the offence due to drink driving, the Defence argued that the uplift in the sentence for this case should be the statutory prescribed minimum fine of $2,000. This was because the accused was only mildly intoxicated at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sections 67(1)(b), 64(1) and 64(2C)(a)/(c) of the RTA </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The new s 67(1)(b) of the RTA since the amendments to the RTA on 1 November 2019 states:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Driving while under influence of drink or drugs</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">67.— (1)    Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    is unfit to drive in that he is under the influence of drink or of a drug or an intoxicating substance to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    has so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath or blood exceeds the prescribed limit,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $20,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For the disqualification period, s 67(2) of the RTA states:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Subject to sections 64(2D) and (2E) and 65(6) and (7), a court convicting a person for an offence under this section in the following cases is to, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to not order or to order otherwise, order that the person be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than the specified period corresponding to that case, starting on the date of the person’s conviction or, where the person is sentenced to imprisonment, on the date of the person’s release from prison:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    for a first offender — 2 years;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    for a repeat offender — 5 years.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As pointed out by both the Prosecution and Defence, the specified minimum sentence for drink driving under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA has doubled from $1,000 to $2,000 for a first offender. The maximum prescribed punishment has also doubled from a fine of $5,000 to $10,000 and an imprisonment from six months to 12 months or to both. The specified minimum DQ period has similarly been raised from one year to two years save for special reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In respect of the dangerous driving charge where no hurt is caused (i.e. the Prosecution calls this the dangerous driving <em>simpliciter</em>), the new s 64(1) of the RTA punishable under s 64(2C)(a) reads as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Reckless or dangerous driving</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">64.—(1)    If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, the person (called the offender) shall be guilty of an offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2C)  In any other case involving the driving of a motor vehicle by the offender, the offender shall on conviction of an offence under subsection (1) —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    be liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both;</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Besides, as the accused was charged with dangerous driving together with drink driving, s 64(2C)(c) read with s 64(2D)(i) reads as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    where the offender is a serious offender in relation to such driving, be liable to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, in addition to any punishment under paragraph (a) or (b); or…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2D)  A court convicting a person of an offence under subsection (1) in the following cases is to, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to not order or to order otherwise, order that the person be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a disqualification period of not less than the specified period corresponding to that case:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    for a serious offender in subsection (2C)(c) — 2 years;</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     A “serious offender” pursuant to s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA is defined in s 64(8) of the RTA as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“serious offender” means an offender who is convicted of an offence under section 67 or 70(4) in relation to the offender’s driving which is an offence under subsection (1);</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The punishment to be imposed under s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA as a serious offender is <u>in addition</u> to any punishment under s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA. It is noted that the prescribed punishment under s 67(1)(b) read with s67(2) of the RTA is the same as that under s 64(2C)(c) read with s 64(2D)(j) of the RTA. The effect of the amendments is that the Prosecution must proceed with both the drink driving charge as well as the charge relating to the behaviour and manner of driving when an accident or incident occurs due to drink driving.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rationale for amendments to the RTA </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The rationale for the amendments to the RTA, which came into force on 1 November 2019, was presented during the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2019 [Bill No. 13/2019] in Parliament on 8 July 2019 (“Second Reading of the RT(A) Bill”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The key reason was to create a greater deterrence against irresponsible driving. Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo said as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">To make our roads safer, <em>we need stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving.</em> We will do this by: <em>(a) enhancing the criminal penalties for irresponsible driving;</em> and (b) tightening the regulatory regime against irresponsible driving. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Irresponsible driving remains a big concern as this affects public safety. Mrs Josephine Teo added:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, <em>irresponsible driving remains a big concern.</em> The number of feedback letters received on irresponsible driving has increased by more than 70% in five years. We also see more video footage of such behaviour being shared online.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Why is this a problem? Because irresponsible driving can have deadly consequences. <em>Even if victims survive the accident, they, or their families, may suffer long-term problems – sometimes, medical; sometimes, permanent disabilities.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Enforcement, education and road safety infrastructure must certainly continue to be improved. <em>But we also need stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving…</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As for the approach to heighten deterrence in order to tackle irresponsible driving offences, Mrs Josephine Teo said:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">I will start with our <em>enhanced approach towards irresponsible driving offences</em>. Today, irresponsible driving offences are prosecuted in two ways. One way is under the Penal Code, for Rash Act and Negligent Act. Another way is under the RTA, for Reckless or Dangerous Driving, and Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration. The penalties differ.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">For better clarity and consistence, we propose to <em>consolidate driving offences under the RTA.</em> We will also streamline the offences into two classes: the first category is Reckless or Dangerous Driving, which I will refer to as Dangerous Driving in the rest of the speech. The second category is Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration, which I will refer to as <em>Careless Driving</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Besides looking at the circumstances of the offence, our enhanced approach will also consider the <em>level of harm caused</em>. If the motorist causes more harm, the level of punishment will be higher.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">There will be <em>four levels of harm</em>: Death, <em>Grievous Hurt</em>, Hurt and Endangering Life. Such tiering of harm is not new in our laws – the Penal Code already has it.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">To summarise, we will enhance our overall approach to <em>penalise irresponsible driving</em> depending on: <em>(a) the circumstances of the offence</em> – whether it constitutes Dangerous Driving or Careless Driving; and <em>(b) the level of harm caused</em> – whether they result in Death, Grievous Hurt, Hurt, or Endangering Life. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Therefore, one reason for the amendments is to consolidate driving offences previously prosecuted under the PC, like rash and negligent acts, under the RTA. This will enable the offences to be streamlined under the RTA into (i) Reckless or Dangerous Driving under s 64 of the RTA; and (ii) Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration (also known as “inconsiderate driving”) under s 65 of the RTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Besides the manner of driving or circumstances in which the traffic offence is committed, the level of harm caused by the offender is also considered in the overall approach. The four levels of harm are (i) Death; (ii) Grievous hurt; (iii) Hurt; and (iv) Endangering life. Therefore, the greater the harm caused, the level of punishment will be higher.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The overall enhanced approach envisaged under the new RTA now encompasses the harm and culpability sentencing factors (i.e. culpability of the offender versus the harm caused by him to others), which the courts have traditionally considered in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on an offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Another reason for the amendments is to enhance the criminal penalties for irresponsible driving offences as a greater form of deterrence. This has holistically increased. Mrs Josephine Teo elaborated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let me move on to the penalties themselves. Today, our penalties for irresponsible driving offences are generally less severe than on other jurisdictions.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">These are manifestly inadequate. Therefore, we intend to raise the penalties. <em>We also need to raise sentencing norms for egregious irresponsible driving offences</em>, particularly those that result in death or some form of permanent disabilities.” [Emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In essence, the enhanced criminal penalties in the amended RTA include introducing higher maximum sentences as compared to the existing penalties under the PC and the RTA. There are also specified minimum sentences (including disqualification periods) to keep irresponsible motorists off the roads for a longer period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     For example, at the lower end of the spectrum, the maximum punishment for a first offender in the past for inconsiderate driving was a fine not exceeding $1,000 or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. Now, the maximum fine for inconsiderate driving where no hurt is caused to any person has increased to $1,500 for a first offender. The maximum imprisonment term remains the same at six months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     At the higher end of the spectrum, the mandatory minimum sentence for dangerous driving causing grievous hurt was an imprisonment term of not less than one year and not more than five years with a specified minimum DQ period of at least eight years. In the past, for causing grievous hurt due to a rash act under the PC, the maximum prescribed punishment was a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to 4 years or both. There was also no specified minimum DQ period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As such, I was of the view that the Defence was incorrect in saying that Parliament had only intended for the sentencing norms to be raised in respect of only the more serious, irresponsible and egregious driving offences and not for dangerous driving cases where no hurt or damage to property is caused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Another point highlighted by the Defence was that the maximum prescribed punishment remains the same under the new s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA as the pre-1 November 2019 s 64(1) of the RTA for a first offender where no hurt is caused, i.e. a fine not exceeding $5,000 or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     However, it is pertinent to point out that in the past, the prescribed punishments for s 64(1) and s 65(1) of the RTA were not specifically calibrated based on the degree of hurt caused by the offender. For example, the entire sentencing range under the pre-1 November 2019 s 64 (1) of the RTA catered to a myriad of scenarios including the various degrees of harm caused. With the 2019 amendments, the same sentencing range is now only applicable to dangerous driving where specifically no hurt is caused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Following from there, for the offence of dangerous driving causing hurt to any person, the maximum fine has since increased to $10,000 for a first offender. The maximum imprisonment term is similarly doubled to two years.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     That being the case, while precedent cases decided under the pre-1 November 2019 s 64(1) of the RTA may still be useful references for cases under s 64(2C)(a) RTA, they may be less relevant where hurt or injury is caused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The 2019 RTA amendments also addressed the offence of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Referring to the Second Reading of the RT(A) Bill again, Mrs Josephine Teo highlighted the perils of drink driving:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Speaker, I will now turn to the amendments for driving under influence. Drivers who are <em>drunk or drug-impaired show a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users. They are one of the biggest contributors to serious accidents on our roads</em>. These are also accidents that clearly could have been avoided if the motorist had not come under influence or did not drive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Therefore, as drink driving is an offence that not only shows the offender’s flagrant disregard of the law but the safety of other road users, it was Parliamentary intention that the criminal penalties must adequately reflect the gravity of drink driving for greater deterrence. The previous criminal penalties were hence inadequate, particularly when an accident is caused. Mrs Josephine Teo added:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Currently, such motorists typically face the same maximum penalties as other motorists who cause accidents. The judge may take into consideration that the offender was driving under influence during the sentencing itself. <em>But it would be clearer to have our intentions codified in law. In fact, our intention is for offenders driving under influence to face stiffer penalties to signal the aggravated seriousness of their actions.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">We therefore propose to introduce additional penalties for a motorist who commit a Dangerous Driving or Careless Driving offence, and who is found guilty for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs; or had refused to take a breathalyser or blood alcohol test when directed by Traffic Police. These will be in the form of additional maximum penalties and additional minimum DQ periods.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">For example, a first-time offender who causes death by Dangerous Driving and had done so while driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs will face an additional maximum jail term of two years, and an additional minimum DQ period of two years. This means that motorists who drink-and-drive, and cause death by Dangerous Driving will now be liable for a maximum jail term of 10 years, and to a minimum DQ period of at least 12 years. Repeat offenders will likewise face higher penalties of up to 19 years in jail and lifetime disqualification from driving. An individual will be deemed a repeat offender for an offence of driving under influence, if he has a previous conviction for driving under influence, for being in charge of a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or for failure to produce a specimen for a drug or alcohol test. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Motorists who cause accidents due to drink driving are expected to face stiffer penalties to signal their heightened culpability as compared to motorists who cause accidents but do not drink and drive. In that event, an offender will face <u>additional penalties</u> as a serious offender under the relevant RTA provisions, i.e. s 64(1) or s 65(1) of the RTA, if the dangerous or inconsiderate driving behaviour was due to or in relation to drink driving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Appositely, Parliament was of the view that it was necessary to increase the criminal penalties for drink driving even when no accidents are caused as such irresponsible behaviour by a motorist is already, in itself, a danger to other road users. Mrs Josephine Teo continued:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Speaker, <em>during the public engagement process, respondents felt that even a standalone driving under influence offence where no accident is caused, should attract higher penalties to better reflect its gravity.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>We agree with this view.</em> The consumption of alcohol or drugs already makes a motorist a danger to other road users. Section 67 in Clause 17 of the Bill <em>will raise the penalties to about double the current levels. We will also raise the existing minimum DQ period to two years for first-time driving under influence offenders and five years for second-time driving under influence offenders.</em> A lifelong disqualification will be imposed on third-time driving under influence offenders. In addition, we will amend section 47C through clause 11 to allow Traffic Police to impose immediate suspension for all driving under influence offences. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In a nutshell, if an offender commits the offence of drink driving or dangerous driving/inconsiderate driving under the new RTA, he must expect to face an increase in criminal penalties for them. He must further expect to face additional penalties as a serious offender if an accident or incident is caused as a consequence of both offences. The additional penalties will depend on whether hurt is caused, and if so, the extent in which such hurt is caused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing framework for drink driving with dangerous driving </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I now come to the approach and sentencing framework when sentencing an offender who has committed the offence of drink driving as well as dangerous or inconsiderate driving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I disagreed with the Defence’s position on the sentencing approach to adopt. In summary, the Defence argued that I should first decide on the sentence of the offender for the drink driving offence based on the sentencing framework as set out in <em>Edwin Suse</em> that focused on the offender’s alcohol level and the appropriate punishment imposed. Thereafter, I should adopt the two-stage sentencing framework as suggested by it by first identifying the appropriate sentence to impose under the primary provision for the offence relating to the manner of driving, i.e. s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA in this case, followed by applying a suitable uplift in the sentence to impose for the offender by virtue of the fact that he is a serious offender in the second stage, i.e. s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     First, this proposed approach by the Defendant would disregard the legislative intent for the amendments to codify the law such that should an accused decide to plead guilty to both his offences of drink driving and dangerous driving or inconsiderate driving, one of the charges can no longer be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. That is to say, both charges must be proceeded on even if an accused decides to plead guilty instead of claiming trial to his charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Second, the Defence’s approach would not take into account the legislative intent for additional penalties to be introduced from the RTA amendments for offenders who are found guilty of drink driving <u>and</u> dangerous or inconsiderate driving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Third, in <em>Edwin Suse</em>, Sundaresh Menon CJ had set out the sentencing framework where the offender was only convicted and sentenced for a singular charge of drink driving. Therefore, the focus on the appropriate level of punishment to be imposed was based purely on the offender’s alcohol level at the material time. One very common example is when the offender is caught for drink driving during a roadblock situation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Hence, if we were to adopt the Defence’s approach, the sentences that may be meted out on an offender may not commensurate with the overall actual harm caused and/or potential harm that may be caused by the offences as well as the offender’s culpability. This may on the contrary, result in a lighter sentence being imposed than in the past pre-amendments. In fact, there was really no reason for the court to consider the fact that the accused had driven against the flow of traffic as an aggravating factor under only the dangerous driving charge as suggested by the Defence, as such manner of driving was evidently closely connected to him having decided to drink and drive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Pertinently, the Defence did not find it necessary to consider the seminal decision of <em>Stansilas</em> as highlighted by the Prosecution. In <em>Stansilas</em>, the question arose as to how the framework in <em>Edwin Suse</em> should be modified when drink driving has resulted in physical harm to a person and/or property, having regard to the facts that those are the very consequences the prohibition on drink driving was intended to prevent (at [2] of <em>Stansilas</em>). Besides giving due regard to the twin parameters of harm caused and the accused’s culpability, there is an interplay between the extent to which the accused’s alcohol level exceeds the prescribed limit and his manner of driving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In <em>Stansilas</em>, the accused had consumed alcohol before driving home after a gathering. At a traffic light junction, he beat the red light. As a consequence, his car brushed against a female pedestrian and collided into a motorcyclist who had the right of way. Both victims were injured. The accused’s alcohol level at the material time was 43µg. He was charged for the offences of drink driving and dangerous driving. On condition of plea, the dangerous driving charge was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     It was held by the High Court that when a person causes personal injury or damage to property as a result of drink driving, the <em>prima facie</em> position is that the custodial threshold has been crossed and a term of imprisonment should be imposed unless the mitigating factors warrant a departure from this starting point: at [39]. At [40] – [42], Menon CJ elaborated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[40]  This approach is consistent with Parliament’s desire to adopt a robust stance against drunk driving. Where such driving has in fact compromised the health and safety of innocent road users and pedestrians, the protection of which was the very aim of Parliament’s amendments to the RTA, a strong sanction is warranted….</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[41]  In <em>Edwin Suse</em>, I rejected the Deputy Public Prosecutor’s argument that the key consideration in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) ought to be the alcohol level of the offender, and not whether any property damage or injury was caused. I explained my view in the following terms (at [30]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">The simple point is that the offence has been aggravated by reason of the harm being actual rather than merely potential, and I see no reason why the appropriate sentence should not reflect this. I acknowledge that there may be arguments over the vagaries of fortune – a drunk driver might fortuitously escape the consequence of harm – but <em>from a punitive or deterrent viewpoint, serious consequences that flow from antisocial, risk-taking behaviour which are the very consequences that were meant to be avoided by the enactment of the offence ought to be visited with sentences of appropriate severity.</em> [emphasis added; emphasis in original omitted]</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[42]  In short, the causing of injury to others – and even more so, death – by a drunk driver represents the very evil that the ban on drunk driving was intended to prevent. <em>Drunk driving has many potential consequences – such as disruption of traffic, fear and alarm to pedestrians and other drivers, damage to public and private property, and detriment to the drunk driver’s own well-being – but at the very pinnacle of the potential harm is physical injury or death of those who are put in harm’s way by the drunk driver’s conduct. It therefore stands to reason that when such harm is in fact caused, the sentence imposed should tend toward the higher region of the sentencing range envisaged by Parliament</em> for the s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) offence. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Even where no actual harm is caused, the actual or potential danger posed by the offender’s conduct in committing the drink driving offence may be manifested by the manner of his driving. This can include the offender’s lack of control of his vehicle or the fact that he was driving dangerously or recklessly. Menon CJ said at [56]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Very often, such dangerous or reckless driving following from the offender’s alcohol consumption will result in a <em>violation of traffic rules, such as speeding, beating a red light, swerving from lane to lane, or in more extreme cases, driving against the flow of traffic or driving off the road.</em> All of this is capable of providing evidence to the sentencing court as to the degree of control (or lack thereof) that the drunk driver had over his vehicle. Other circumstances that increase the danger to road users include driving during the rush hour or within residential or school zones, driving a heavy vehicle, or setting out to drive a substantial distance to reach a destination: <em>Edwin Suse</em> at [28]. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In coming to the sentencing framework for an offender who has caused damage property or harm to others due to drink driving, Menon CJ opined at [73]-[75]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[73]  It will not be possible definitively or exhaustively to identify the particular features of cases for which particular types or lengths of sentences will be appropriate. In the final analysis, the appropriate sentence to be imposed will be the product of a <em>fact-sensitive exercise of discretion</em>, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. However, generalising from the precedents described above, certain broad features may be observed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[74]  To begin, it seems to me that in assessing the overall gravity of the offence, it is (as noted above) relevant to consider, <em>first the degree of harm caused; and second, the culpability of the offender.</em> In relation to the latter consideration, this will entail consideration of the extent to which the offender’s alcohol level exceeds the prescribed limit as well as the manner of the offender’s driving.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[75]  In my judgment, it is possible to calibrate these factors as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Harm</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    Slight - slight or moderate property damage and/or slight physical injury characterised by no hospitalisation or medical leave;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   Moderate – serious property damage and/or moderate personal injury characterised by hospitalisation or medical leave but no fractures or permanent injures;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(iii)   Serious – serious personal injury usually involving fractures including injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(iv)   Very serious – loss of limb, sight or hearing or life; or paralysis.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Culpability</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    Low – low alcohol level and no evidence of dangerous driving behaviour;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   Medium – moderate to high alcohol level or dangerous driving behaviour;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(iii)   High – high alcohol level and dangerous driving behaviour. [Emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     At [77] of <em>Stansilas</em>, it was held that save in a case involving slight harm and low culpability, the <em>prima facie</em> position is that the custodial threshold has been crossed, and unless this is displaced by reason of sufficiently strong mitigating factors, the court will then have to determine the length of the custodial sentence to impose on the offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     At [78] Menon CJ set out in <em>Stansilas</em> the indicative sentencing ranges, which were calibrated according to the degree of harm caused and the offender’s culpability. This was intended to assist sentencing courts in assessing the appropriate sentence, having regard to the particular facts of a case. He emphasized at [76] that these were indicative categories to assist analysis and are to be assessed as a matter of common sense. A summary table of the sentencing framework in <em>Stansilas</em> is as follows:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0019_Image/[2021] SGDC 0019_image2.png" style="height:128.517631944444pt;width:258.251666666667pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Pursuant to the RTA amendments, as the maximum prescribed punishment has since doubled from a fine of $5,000 to $10,000 and an imprisonment from six months to 12 months or to both, taking into account the court’s obligation to utilise the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament (See <em>Poh Boon Kiat v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17081-SSP.xml')">[2014] 4 SLR 892</a> (<em>“Poh Boon Kiat”)</em> at [60]), I was in general agreement with the Prosecution that a revised sentencing framework may be as follows:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGDC 0019_Image/[2021] SGDC 0019_image3.png" style="height:126.646243055556pt;width:268.871798611111pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     These revised guidelines, having taken guidance from the previous sentencing framework in <em>Stansilas</em>, would take into consideration the legislative intent for a heightened need of deterrence. At the same time, each case must be looked at carefully and holistically in the entire analysis of the evidence before the court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Moreover, the increase in criminal penalties in the revised guidelines would further cater to or take into account the additional penalties an offender is likely to face as a serious offender in the calibration of both the global and individual sentences that an accused should receive for the drink driving and dangerous/inconsiderate driving offences. At the same time, this would alleviate the Defence’s concern of double counting.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate sentence to impose </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Culpability of the accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I was of the view that the accused’s culpability here was at <u>the higher end of medium</u>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    This was because there was a deliberate act of dangerous driving on his part by making a three-point turn and drove against the flow of traffic in order to evade the roadblock ahead of him. He did so intentionally because he knew that he had drank earlier before driving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    While the Defence sought to downplay his culpability by arguing that he only drove against the flow of traffic for a rather short distance of not more than 300m and it was early in the morning at 4.05am at the material time where traffic flow was expected to be light, this to me was neither here nor there. Had the accused not been caught by the alert Traffic Police officers on duty, he would have driven a longer distance against the flow of traffic to escape and thereafter to his final destination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Furthermore, as pointed out by the Prosecution, in deliberately taking the risk to evade the roadblock, the accused had to drive round a bend from Crawford Street to Beach Road, which is a potential blind spot for vehicles proceeding straight ahead in the correct direction. There was also a zebra crossing just after the bend along Beach Road. Added to the fact that it was still dark in the early hours of the morning. The accused’s action therefore could have resulted in a head-on collision with unsuspecting oncoming vehicles or an accident with unaware pedestrians using the zebra crossing at that time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    It was apparent that the accused’s action had put the safety of other road users and the Traffic Police officers on duty at risk. Such egregious behaviour should not be condoned.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    On top of that, the accused’s alcohol level was within band 1 at 46µg. Pursuant to the harm-culpability framework as set out in <em>Stansilas</em>, where the offender has low alcohol level <u>and</u> there is evidence of dangerous driving behaviour on his part at the time of the offence, his culpability is at the very least in the medium category.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Further, in the High Court’s decision of <em>Neo Chuan Sheng v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24531-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 97</a> (<em>“Neo Chuan Sheng”)</em>, it was held at [8] that the culpability of the accused, who had deliberately reversed against the flow of traffic for a significant distance (it was 203m) in the early hours of the morning and had done so in order to undermine police operations, was medium. The accused in <em>Neo Chuan Sheng</em> did not commit the offence of drink driving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Following from there, given the accused here had not only committed the offence of drink driving but also the offence of dangerous driving in an intentional and purposeful manner to avoid being caught for drink driving at the roadblock, his culpability must be at the higher end of medium.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Harm caused by the offence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As for the harm caused, including any potential harm that might have been caused, I was of the view that it was at the <u>higher end of slight</u>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    It was fortuitous that no one was injured and no damage was caused to any property.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    As for potential harm, as reiterated earlier, the accused’s action had put the safety of other road users and the Traffic Police officers on duty at risk. Even if there were no other vehicles or pedestrians along the road or any evidence to suggest that such other vehicles or pedestrians could reasonably have been expected to be on the road at the material time such that some form of evasive action might have to be taken, it was held at [7] in <em>Neo Chuan Sheng</em> that the potential harm in a comparable situation should still be at the higher end of slight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In the circumstances, applying <em>Stansilas</em>, given that the culpability of the accused was at the higher end of medium and the harm caused as well as potential harm that might be caused was at the higher end of slight, I was in general agreement with both the Prosecution and Defence and was satisfied that the custodial threshold has been crossed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Additionally, based on the revised guidelines arising from the <em>Stansilas</em> sentencing framework to take into account the RTA amendments, the sentencing range for the period of imprisonment would be up to two months in the accused’s case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mitigating factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In coming to my decision on the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I gave due consideration to the accused’s remorsefulness and his early plea of guilt. I further noted that he had cooperated fully with investigations after he was arrested for attempting to evade the roadblock.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    As for his driving record, I accepted that he had a relatively clean driving record. Effectively, this was his first brush with the law and he had no previous convictions.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasons for not imposing Short Detention Order (SDO)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The Defence’s reasons for seeking this court to impose a SDO in lieu of the custodial sentence were primarily that this was a one-off aberration, the accused was relatively young when he committed the offences, is still in his late twenties and has great potential for rehabilitation. The SDO would ensure the accused experience the “clang of the prison gates”. At the same time, it would be less stigmatising to the accused as his criminal record would be rendered spent upon completion of the SDO.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The Defence sought to persuade me, without any supporting evidence, of the accused’s contributions to the society despite his young age as well as his potential to contribute more to the society as an entrepreneur and community service volunteer. Defence counsel submitted that the SDO would enable the accused to continue to play his part in being a good citizen allow him to be present for his small business during such difficult times due to the covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    For a start, I was uncertain how the SDO would aid the accused to be present for his small business given that he would still be incarcerated during the relevant period of the SDO even if this was imposed. Also, regardless of whether SDO is imposed, I was of the view that the accused would still be able to continue to contribute to the society as an entrepreneur or a community service volunteer if he wishes to.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    As for the sentencing philosophy behind CBS like SDO, reference can be taken from the Second Reading of the Criminal Procedure Bill [Bill No. 11/2010, <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> vol. 87] on 18 May 2010 where Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs (as he then was), Mr K Shanmugam said at column 422:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rationale for having community sentences</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our sentencing philosophy is aimed at deterrence, prevention, retribution and rehabilitation. A fair sentencing framework is one that enable the Court to deliver the correct mix of these four objectives on the specific facts of each case. CBS gives more flexibility to the Courts. Not every offender should be put in prison. CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the Courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum: regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions. For such cases, it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community. The offender remains gainfully employed and his family benefits from the focused treatment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    As to whether an accused should be accorded greater leniency due to public service or contributions to the community, guidance can be taken from <em>Stansilas</em> where Menon CJ elaborated at [94]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, it is necessary to justify the mitigating value of public service and contributions by reference to the four established principles of sentencing: retribution, prevention, deterrence (both specific and general) and rehabilitation (see <em>PP v Tan Fook Sum</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022.xml')">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022</a> (“<em>Tan Fook Sum</em>”) at [15]). …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Addressing specifically on the offence of drink driving and the focus on deterrence as a sentencing principle, Menon CJ highlighted at [99] – [100]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[99]  I turn to the third sentencing objective, which is that of deterrence. The aim of specific deterrence is to discourage a particular offender from reoffending by instilling in him the fear of the consequences of re-offending through the potential threat of re-experiencing a similar sanction as previously imposed (or perhaps even a more serious one): <em>PP v Law Aik Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> (“<em>Law Aik Meng</em>”) at [21]. The offender’s good character and good works might suggest that the commission of the offence is an aberration and is unlikely to reoccur. His record of good works provides reason to think that he will continue to contribute to the community rather than cause harm to it through criminal acts. As explained in <em>Ang Peng Tiam</em> ([88] supra) at [102], such matters are mitigating in so far as they fairly allow the court to infer that the offender had acted “out of character” and that it may therefore not be necessary to impose a heavier punishment in order to specifically deter him from reoffending.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[100] But the deterrence principle has a second aspect. <em>The purpose of general deterrence is to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of the particular offender</em>: <em>Tan Fook Sum</em> ([94] supra) at [18]. <em>It is particularly relevant in the context of offences affecting public safety and public health</em>: <em>Law Aik Meng</em> at [24(d)]. <em>The prohibition on drunk driving under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA is evidently such an offence. For the reasons explained at [43]–[44] above, general deterrence ought to play a large part in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on a drunk driver, particularly one who has caused injury to another.</em> In <em>Ang Peng Tiam</em>, it was noted at [103] that the mitigating value of past contributions “will be readily displaced” if the court is <em>satisfied that there are other sentencing considerations that override this</em>. More specifically, “if the key sentencing objective is general deterrence, …the focus then would be on sending a clear message to others of the harsh consequences that await those who might be thinking of following in the offender’s footsteps”. In the circumstances, <em>any mitigating weight afforded by a lessened need to specifically deter a drunk driver will be readily offset by the interest of general deterrence.</em> [Emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Specifically, as drink driving is an offence that affects public safety and health, the interest of general deterrence is compelling and plays a great part in determining the sentence to be imposed on a drunk driver. Hence, any mitigating weight from past contributions to the society will be lessened and readily offset as a matter of public policy to protect road users and enhance road safety.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Here, I doubted very much that the mere fact the accused had committed the offence out of character and as a one-off aberration plus his contributions to the community would suffice to justify imposing a SDO.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Pertinently, the accused had given no good reasons to absolve him for choosing to drive after having consumed alcohol. He conceded that he had purposefully driven to the night club at about 2.30am on 11 February 2020. Despite that, he chose to consume alcohol due to his personal issues. It appeared, for all intents and purposes, he had decided to drive home from the night club for no better reason other than it was convenient to do so at the material time. The accused irresponsibly made a conscious decision to drive to the club to drink <u>and</u> drive home after drinking.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Even then, had the accused accepted his earlier mistake of drink driving by not evading the roadblock, he would only have been imposed with the usual sentence of an appropriate fine and DQ order as a first offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In Parliament, it was asked during the Second Reading of the RT(A) Bill where a SDO can apply to RTA offences, Mrs Josephine Teo replied:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The answer is yes, if the offence and offender meet the requirements set out under the Criminal Procedure Code, such as not having a specified or mandatory minimum imprisonment. One example is the offence of Careless Driving as well as <em>first-time Driving Under Influence offenders</em>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Unfortunately, the accused did not merely commit an offence of drink driving. One mistake perpetuated to another mistake when he decided to evade the roadblock by driving dangerously and recklessly away from it against the flow of traffic to avoid arrest. Whilst this might have been another one-off aberration, it was yet another conscious decision on his part to defy police orders and escape from the authorities in a concerted and dangerous manner. In taking such a calculated risk, the accused had no regard for the safety of others.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    This, in my view, called for a sharper focus on general deterrence in such a situation. There is a clear need to send a greater and stronger message to others of the harsh consequences that awaits those who may be thinking of following in the footsteps of the accused to avoid the consequences of the law.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Hence, the case of <em>Ernest Sim</em> could and should be distinguished from the present case on the facts as the nature of the offences are evidently differing. In <em>Ernest Sim</em>, the charge was not only reduced from s 324 to s 337 of the PC, there was inconclusive evidence as to the degree of dangerousness posed by the airsoft arms used by the offender in question. The hurt caused in that case was also transient in nature. The High Court therefore imposed a SDO of one week in place of the one week’s imprisonment under the reduced charge on the offender who was then 25 years old.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Finally, although the accused may be in his late twenties, he is not a youthful offender. All in all, taking into account the nature of the offences and the evidence before me as a whole, I was of the view that a sentence of a SDO was not an appropriate sentence to impose on the accused. Following from there, I declined to order a CSO as well.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The global sentence imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    It now leaves me to determine the appropriate duration of the custodial sentence that should be imposed on the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The list of cases cited by the Defence in its table provided limited assistance to the present case because they dealt with only the offence of dangerous driving. The accused in those cases either did not commit or was not charged for the additional offence of drink driving. This is crucial because drink driving is an aggravating factor that directly impacts on the sentence to impose on an offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Moreover, <em>Koh Thiam</em> Huat, <em>Teoh Wei</em> Keat, and <em>Ng Hai Chong</em> were decided based on the even earlier s 64(1) of the RTA prior to 20 June 2017 where the prescribed maximum sentence was a fine of $3,000 or an imprisonment of 12 months or both. As highlighted in <em>Neo Chuan Sheng</em> by Chua Lee Meng J at [50], the older pre-20 June 2017 cases were of limited assistance even if the RTA amendments did not affect DQ orders under s 42(1) of the RTA like s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA in the present case:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, both of these cases were of limited assistance because they were decided before the maximum fine for s 64(1) RTA offences had been increased with effect from 20 June 2017. Although the RTA amendment did not affect disqualification orders under s 42(1) RTA, <em>Parliament’s intent to deter offences of dangerous driving is reflected by the increase in the maximum fine that can be imposed for such offences. This heightened need for deterrence means that the court should take a tougher stance in respect of disqualification orders as well. As the DJ noted (GD, at [33]), there has been a concomitant increase in the length of the disqualification orders imposed for offences committed after that date</em>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    As for <em>Chan Choon Seng</em>, it was decided based on the pre-1 November 2019 s 64(1) of the RTA where the prescribed maximum fine was raised to $5,000 with the prescribed maximum imprisonment term remaining the same at 12 months. The maximum prescribed punishment for the pre-1 November 2019 s 64(1) of the RTA is the same as the current s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In <em>Chan Choon Seng</em>, the accused had deliberately sped along a busy expressway in a bid to escape from the Traffic Police. He was eventually arrested for dangerous driving. At [119] of my decision, I stated that the starting point for similar cases where an offender makes a calculated and deliberate decision to drive dangerously thereby increasing the danger to other road users was <u>two weeks’ imprisonment</u>. This was particularly so when the offender drives dangerously to evade the authorities or arrest for an offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The accused in <em>Chan Choon Seng</em> was eventually imposed a sentence of five days’ imprisonment primarily because of his ill health as a mitigating factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I disagreed with the Defence’s argument that the accused here was less culpability than the accused in <em>Chan Choon Seng</em>. Here, it must be emphasized that the accused intentionally and consciously drove against the flow of traffic and under the influence of alcohol in a bid to avoid the roadblock and any arrest from drink driving. He did so because he knew that he might not have passed the breathalyser test at the roadblock. Had he not been caught for the dangerous act, he would have continued to drive dangerously over a longer distance home.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Taking everything in totality, I would say that the accused here was more culpability than the accused in <em>Chan Choon Seng</em>. Following from there, I disagreed with the Defence that the accused should be sentenced to not more than five days’ imprisonment for the dangerous driving charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    On top of that, the accused is liable to be sentenced under both s 64 (2C)(a) and s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA as a serious offender. The sentence to be imposed on the accused must therefore take into account the additional penalties envisaged under s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA when an offender decides to drink and drive dangerously. The additional fine of $2,000 as suggested by the Defence would not be adequate to meet the ends of justice.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Given that the accused has pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, I agreed with the Prosecution that the starting point sentence within the revised sentencing range is four weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Having considered the mitigating factors of the accused as mentioned above, I was of the view that a downward adjustment in the custodial sentence would be appropriate. Accordingly, I imposed a custodial sentence of <u>17 days’ imprisonment</u> on the accused for the drink driving and dangerous driving charges respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    As both offences arose from a single occurrence or incident, I ordered both sentences to run concurrently.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    As for the disqualification order, in view of the 2019 RTA amendments, the sentencing benchmarks as stated in <em>Edwin Suse</em> for first offenders who have committed only a drink driving offence (i.e. drink driving <em>simpliciter</em>) may be revised as follows:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="34.12%"/> <col width="24.46%"/> <col width="41.42%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Level of alcohol</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>(μg per 100 ml of breath)</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Range of fines</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Range of disqualification</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">35 – 54 </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000 – $4,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24 – 30 months</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">55 – 69</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$4,000 –$6,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30 – 36 months</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">70 – 89</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$6,000 – $8,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36 – 48 months</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> ≥ 90</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&gt; $ 8,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">48 – 60 months (or longer)</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Thus, had the accused been caught at the roadblock on the fateful day, the likely DQ to be imposed on him would have been between 24 to 30 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    However, because the accused has also concomitantly committed the offence of dangerous driving, there should be an uplift in the duration of the DQ order to take into account the additional penalties to be imposed when an offender is considered a “serious offender”. S 64(2D)(i) of the RTA requires a serious offender to be imposed with a DQ period of not less than the specified period of two years (i.e. 24 months).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Ordinarily, had the accused not committed the offence of drink driving, I would say that, based on similar facts, the starting point DQ order to be imposed would at least be 18 months for the dangerous driving offence. This was bearing in mind that the DQ order imposed in <em>Chan Choon Sing</em> was already 36 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Given the circumstances here, I was of the view that the appropriate global DQ period for both offences should be 24 + 18 = <u>42 months</u>. This DQ order would ensure that the primary sentencing consideration of both specific and general deterrence in respect of the offences arising from drink driving and dangerous driving was met.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    All things considered, having duly examined all the evidence as a whole including the culpability of the accused, the potential and actual harm due to the present offences as well as any mitigating or aggravating factors, I sentenced the accused to a global sentence of <u>17 days’ imprisonment and DQAC for 42 months</u>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    As the accused had wanted to defer serving sentence to 4 November 2020, I made the DQ order to take with effect from 30 October 2020 for the dangerous driving charge and from date of release for the drink driving charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as
