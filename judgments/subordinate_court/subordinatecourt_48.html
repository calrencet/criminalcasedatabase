time of the offence. He faced 1 charge, MAC-908033-2019 (the “Charge”), in respect of an offence under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”).

I convicted him on the Charge. I sentenced the Accused to 8 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Accused filed an appeal against the conviction and the sentence. A stay on the execution of the sentence has been granted and the Accused is out on bail pending appeal in the sum of $10,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases: The Prosecution’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Prosecution asserted that on 5 March 2018, at about 6 pm, the Accused had seen the Victim near the foot of Block X. The Victim, who enjoyed looking at aeroplanes fly past, was on his way to the 12<sup>th</sup> floor of Block X to look at aeroplanes flying past, and took the lift up.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Accused loitered at the foot of Block X, then followed the Victim by taking the same lift up subsequently. At the 12<sup>th</sup> floor of Block X, the Accused used his hand to touch the Victim’s penis from the outside of his clothes, intending to outrage his modesty. The Accused also asked the Victim to show him what was beneath his pants, which the Victim declined.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Prosecution called a total of 5 witnesses. They were:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Sergeant Muhammad Isa Bin Md Rashid (“Sergeant Muhammad Isa”) (PW1);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Inspector Chan Zhi Yao (“Inspector Chan”) (PW2);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Victim (PW3);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Victim’s mother (PW4); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_e"></a>(e)     Station Inspector Quek Han Xiong Darren (“SI Darren”) (PW5).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases: The Defence’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Accused’s defence was that he was a Good Samaritan, and was trying to prevent the Victim from committing suicide from the 12<sup>th</sup> floor of Block X. Any contact his hand made with the Victim was not intentional.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 5 March 2018, the Accused did not go to work because he was feeling unwell. He was “feeling a great deal of pain because of [his] arm condition”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He was on his way home after buying dinner for his wife, when he encountered the Victim, <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> near the foot of Block X.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Victim appeared depressed and suicidal to him. He saw the Victim enter the lift of Block X and head up. The Accused asserted that he followed suit in a subsequent lift as he was concerned about the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Accused saw the Victim at the 12<sup>th</sup> floor of Block X, near the parapet and on tiptoe. The Accused alleged that he himself was afraid of heights, so he beckoned the Victim to come towards him and away from the parapet.

Aggravating factors include the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, and relevant antecedents demonstrating recalcitrance. Mitigating factors include a timeous plea of guilt or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused that relates to the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In particular, the Prosecution argued that the present case fell within Band 2 of the Kunesekaran framework because of 2 offence specific aggravating factors present.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Firstly, the degree of sexual exploitation was considerable. Although there was no skin-to-skin contact, the Accused intruded upon the Victim’s private parts by touching the Victim’s penis over the Victim’s pants.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Secondly, the circumstances of the offence demonstrated clear premeditation. The Accused stalked the Victim from the void deck of Block X to the 12<sup>th</sup> floor of Block X. He observed the Victim for 15 minutes before deciding to strike.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The Prosecution highlighted 2 cases which similarly involved the intrusion of private parts over clothes. Both the accused had pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution further argued that an uplift to 10 months was appropriate in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In <b><em>PP v Azmi Bin Mohammad Eunos</em></b>, the accused Azmi pleaded guilty to two Section 354(1) Penal Code charges. His victim was a 15 year old male Azmi spotted his victim at the void deck and entered the same lift as his victim. Azmi pressed the victim for his phone number. When both exited the lift at the 9<sup>th</sup> floor, Azmi used his right hand and brushed the victim’s penis over his shorts. This constituted Azmi’s 1<sup>st</sup> charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Azmi’s victim then pressed for the lift and entered the lift. Azmi followed. The victim pressed the lift button for the 10<sup>th</sup> floor, and as the lift doors closed and ascended, Azmi used his right hand to brush (in an upward motion) the victim’s buttocks over his shorts. This constituted Azmi’s 2<sup>nd</sup> charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Azmi was heavily traced for drug-related antecedents. Azmi was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for his 1<sup>st</sup> charge and 3 months’ imprisonment for his 2<sup>nd</sup> charge, both sentences ran concurrently giving rise to a global sentence of 8 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In <b><em>GCO v PP</em></b>, the accused GCO pleaded guilty to one Section 354(1) Penal Code charge and one Section 509 Penal Code charge. His victim was working with him on a project at a computer lab at the university in the early hours of the morning. They eventually fell asleep.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    GCO woke up and noticed that the victim was asleep. He placed his hand through the opening of the shorts of his victim and touched the vagina area from underneath the shorts. This constituted GCO’s 1<sup>st</sup> charge under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    GCO’s 2<sup>nd</sup> charge, under Section 509 of the Penal Code, took place about 2 years earlier. He peeped at his victim, who was fully naked, in the female toilet of the hall of residence of the university.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    GCO was untraced. GCO was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for his 1<sup>st</sup> charge under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, and a fine of $2,000 for his 2<sup>nd</sup> charge under Section 509 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation and the Accused’s Submissions on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In response to the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, the Accused reiterated that he was just trying to save the Victim and he was innocent and would not have pleaded guilty. The Accused added that he was a very helpful person who, for example, lent money to a lady with 5 children, whose husband was in jail.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I found that the facts of the present case revealed 2 or more offence-specific facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    I noted that the Accused had touched the Victim’s private part (penis), for about 1 to 2 seconds. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Whilst I did not find that the touch was anything more than fleeting, I noted that the Accused had targeted the Victim after seeing him near the foot of Block X, and after loitering at the foot of Block X for a while, subsequently trailed him up to the 12<sup>th</sup> floor of Block X. The Accused also observed the Victim at the 12<sup>th</sup> floor before he approached the Victim. Premeditation was present.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    As such, I found that the present case would appropriately be placed in Band 2 of the Kunesekaran framework.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    I recognised that in the present case, there was no skin-on-skin contact, and as such, would not warrant the higher end of Band 2.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    To the Accused’s credit, he had no antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    However, the Accused claimed trial. The mitigating weight to be accorded to a timeous plea of guilt would not be applicable in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The sentence to be meted to the Accused must serve the purpose of <b>retribution and deterrence</b>, to deter like-minded individuals from committing such offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    I determined that <b>an imprisonment term of 8 months was appropriate</b> in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    This imprisonment term of 8 months would not be discordant with the sentences meted out in <b><em>PP v Azmi Bin Mohammad Eunos</em></b> and <b><em>GCO v PP</em></b>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In <b><em>PP v Azmi Bin Mohammad Eunos</em></b>, the “modus operandi” of the accused Azmi was similar to that of the Accused. Azmi was sentenced to a global sentence of 8 months, for 2 charges. In our present case, the Accused had only been charged with, and found guilty under, 1 charge. Yet, Azmi had furnished a timeous plea of guilt, but the Accused had not. As such, comparing and contrasting the various factors, a sentence of 8 months for the Accused would not be incongruent with the sentence meted out to Azmi.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    In <b><em>GCO v PP</em></b>, the accused GCO had, for his Section 354 Penal Code charge, placed his hand through the opening of the shorts of his victim and touched the vagina area from underneath the shorts. That, to me, was more aggravated than the touching of the Victim’s penis over clothes in the present case. That being said, GCO had furnished a timeous plea of guilt, but the Accused had not. As such, comparing and contrasting the various factors, a sentence of 8 months for the Accused would not be incongruent with the sentence meted out to GCO.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    As the Accused was above the age of 50 at the time of the sentencing, caning was not a viable sentencing option.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    I sentenced the Accused to 8 months’ imprisonment. Given the imprisonment spectrum of two years, the facts of the case, and the case precedents, 8 months’ imprisonment would not be manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The Accused, dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence has filed an appeal. The Accused is presently out on bail pending appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>_________________________________________</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGMC 0022_Image/[2021] SGMC 0022_image1.png" style="height:219.888194444444pt;width:289.831354166667pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a></p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>NE, Day 2, page 37, line 3 to line 9</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>NE, Day 2, page 38, line 10 to line 17</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 8, line 20 to line 32</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 9, line 2 to line 21</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 10, line 19 to line 29 and NE, Day 3, page 11, line 5 to line 6</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE, Day 1, page 36, line 21 to line 26</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 51, line 20</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 51, line 32</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 52, line 6</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 82, line 18 to line 25</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 7, line 4 to line 19</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 7, line 23 to line 32</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_13_1" id="Ftn_13">[note: 13]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 8, line 6 to line 10</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_14_1" id="Ftn_14">[note: 14]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 8, line 11 to line 17</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_15_1" id="Ftn_15">[note: 15]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 8, line 1 to line 5</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_16_1" id="Ftn_16">[note: 16]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 39, line 22 to line 26</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_17_1" id="Ftn_17">[note: 17]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 37, line 13 to line 31</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_18_1" id="Ftn_18">[note: 18]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 13, line 1 to line 9</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_19_1" id="Ftn_19">[note: 19]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 6, line 10 to line 15</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_20_1" id="Ftn_20">[note: 20]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 28, line 1 to line 2</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_21_1" id="Ftn_21">[note: 21]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 27, line 23 to line 25</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_22_1" id="Ftn_22">[note: 22]</a></sup>NE, Day 4, page 28, line 3 to line 5</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_23_1" id="Ftn_23">[note: 23]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 33, line 31 to page 24, line 3</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_24_1" id="Ftn_24">[note: 24]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 37, line 3 to line 12</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_25_1" id="Ftn_25">[note: 25]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 41, line 8 to line 11</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_26_1" id="Ftn_26">[note: 26]</a></sup>NE, Day 3, page 42, line 2 to line 7</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_27_1" id="Ftn_27">[note: 27]</a></sup>Exhibit P3</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_28_1" id="Ftn_28">[note: 28]</a></sup>NE, Day 1, page 19, lines 29 to 31</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_29_1" id="Ftn_29">[note: 29]</a></sup>Exhibit P4.
