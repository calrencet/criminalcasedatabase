Nakhoda:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Accused was the sole proprietor of two businesses, Wah Ye Advertising (Wah Yee) and Little Box Event and Exhibition Printing (Little Box). Both entities were in the manufacture of builders’ carpentry, joinery and advertising printing. The Accused wilfully with intent to evade tax had excluded certain sales transactions of the businesses and, thereby, omitted the GST input tax of the transaction from her GST returns.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Accused pleaded guilty to three charges for offences s 62(1)(b) punishable under s 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GSTA). I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment, and I imposed the statutorily mandated penalty of $323,733.33. The primary issue in this case was whether the Court should adopt a new sentencing framework set out by the Prosecution for tax evasion offences under the GSTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Accused and the Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentence have appealed. The Accused is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The details of the three charges are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>MSC 902209 of 2020</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You, Pua Om Tee, are charged that you on or about 25th day of October 2014, in Singapore, being the sole proprietor of Wah Ye Advertising (ROB XXX), and Little Box Event &amp; Exhibition Printing (ROB XXX), did, wilfully with intent to evade tax, make false entries in your Goods and Services Tax F5 Return for the accounting period, 1 July 2014 to 30 September 2014 (both dates inclusive) by not accounting for standard-rated supplies of $306,769, which resulted in the undercharging of tax amounting to $29,928.95 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 62(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Chapter 117A), punishable under Section 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the said Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>MSC 902211 of 2020</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You, Pua Om Tee, are charged that you on or about 31st day of October 2015, in Singapore, being the sole proprietor of Wah Ye Advertising (ROB XXX), and Little Box Event &amp; Exhibition Printing (ROB XXX), did, wilfully with intent to evade tax, make false entries in your Goods and Services Tax F5 Return for the accounting period, 1 July 2015 to 30 September 2015 (both dates inclusive) by not accounting for standard-rated supplies of $380,069 which resulted in the undercharging of tax amounting to $28,751.90 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 62(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Chapter 117A), punishable under Section 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the said Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>MSC 902212 of 2020</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You, Pua Om Tee, are charged that you on or about 30th day of January 2016, in Singapore, being the sole proprietor of Wah Ye Advertising (ROB XXX), and Little Box Event &amp; Exhibition Printing (ROB XXX), did, wilfully with intent to evade tax, make false entries in your Goods and Services Tax F5 Return for the accounting period, 1 October 2015 to 31 December 2015 (both dates inclusive) by not accounting for standard-rated supplies of $574,515, which resulted in the undercharging of tax amounting to $49,230.26 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 62(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Chapter 117A), punishable under Section 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the said Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Accused is Pua Om Tee, a 59-year-old female Singaporean Citizen.

Ong made the adjustments and excluded selected supplies, and the consequent output tax, from the Accused’s GST F5 returns for three quarterly periods from 1 April 2013 to September 2016. After Ong made the adjustments the Accused had approved the figures and Ong filed the GST F5 returns on behalf of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As a result of the adjustments and exclusions the Accused’s GST returns for three quarterly period, 1 July to 30 September 2014, 1 July to 30 September 2015 and 1 October to 31 December 2015 contained false entries as they reflected the adjusted GST figures rather than the actual GST figures.

The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Prosecution stated that it had previously submitted for the adoption of a proposed sentencing framework (PSF) for offences of income tax evasion under s 96(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, Rev Ed 2014) (ITA). In <em>PP v Lam Allan</em> (SC-910273-2018) and <em>PP v Ng Wee Kheng</em> (SC-906871-2019), the District Judge had adopted the Prosecution’s PSF. The Prosecution also submitted that in <em>PP v Yeo Soh Khim</em> (SC-911176-2019) for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA the Court had also adopted the Prosecution’s PSF for GSTA offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Prosecution highlighted that the State Courts’ had been taking reference from the case of <em>Chng Gim Huat v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0360.xml')">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 360</a> to calibrate the appropriate sentences for tax evasion offences and that the sentences imposed post-<em>Chng Gim Huat</em> did not utilise the full sentencing range under section 96(1) of the ITA as there had been a clustering of sentences at the very low end of the range. In <em>Ng Wee Kheng</em> and <em>Lam Allan</em>, the court had accepted this and taken guidance from the Prosecution’s PSF when sentencing offences under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Prosecution, submitted that sentences for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offences had, similarly, not utilised the full sentencing range (which was up to a maximum of seven years’ imprisonment).

In relation to the Accused’s culpability, the Prosecution submitted that her culpability was low as there was little planning or premeditation on the Accused’s part, that the <em>modus operandi</em> of the offences was not particularly sophisticated and did not involve obfuscation or falsification of source documents. The Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentencing range would be a sentence of imprisonment up to 14 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Prosecution submitted that the appropriate starting point for the sentences for the proceeded charges were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     MSC-902209-2019 (GST evaded: $29,928.95): 18 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     MSC-902211-2019 (GST evaded: $28,751.90): 17 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     MSC-902212-2019 (GST evaded: $49,230.86): 30 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     At step four, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused had consented to eight similar charges being TIC’ed and that this should be taken as an aggravating factor. The Prosecution accepted as mitigating that the Accused had pleaded guilty, was remorseful, had cooperated with the authorities and that she had not antecedents. As such, the Prosecution proposed that the court impose a 50% discount to starting point sentences and submitted for the sentences at paragraph [12] above.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Prosecution submitted that two of the sentences should run consecutively and that a global sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment (approximately six months’ imprisonment) would not fall foul of either the one transaction rule or the totality principle.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Defence submitted that sentences of three weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $3,000 should be imposed on the Accused for each of the proceeded charges and for a global sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $9,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Defence referred to <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> and submitted that both the Prosecution and the courts had been guided by the sentence meted out in that case and, as a result, had imposed sentences ranging between three weeks’ and one month for GST evasion offences. The Defence referred to the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents for section 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offences<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and that the statistics demonstrated that sentences had tended to cluster at the very low end of the sentencing range.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Defence submitted that the District Court was bound by the sentences imposed in precedent cases, especially precedents from a higher court, to give effect to the principles of respect and sentencing consistency. The Defence submitted that the proper course for the court to take if it disagreed with the current sentencing precedents established by <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> would be to express disagreement with the decision and suggest that the sentencing framework should be reconsidered by the High Court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>Loon Wai Yang v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24158-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 34</a>, the offender had appealed against his conviction and sentence on five charges for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA. The Prosecution had filed a cross-appeal against sentence. On appeal, the offender was acquitted on four of the five charges. For the fifth charge, for which the conviction was upheld, Chua Lee Meng J upheld the District Court judge’s sentence of three weeks imprisonment for an offence where the offender evaded GST in the amount of $41,252.65. Based on this precedent, the Defence submitted that the individual sentences for the three charges proceeded against the Accused should not exceed three weeks’ per charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Defence submitted that the Prosecutions PSF was arbitrary as the level of harm appeared to be determined solely by reference to the amount of tax evaded and that other factors that would have an effect on the harm, such as the involvement of a syndicate or a transnational element, had not been factored into the framework. The Defence submitted that whilst the sentence bands may have been appropriate the assignment of $75,000 tax evaded as the upper limit for level 1 harm appeared arbitrary.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally, the Defence submitted that the imposition of sentences far above the norm that had been imposed by the Courts since <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> would be contrary to the Accused’s legitimate expectations. Based on the Prosecution’s submissions the sentences to be imposed on the Accused would represent a fivefold increase, i.e. from three weeks’ to four months’ imprisonment, and this would be a very significant change from the sentencing benchmarks. Therefore, the Defence submitted that even if the PSF was proper, it should not be applied to the Accused as it would breach her legitimate expectations that her offences would warrant a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment for each of the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Defence confirmed that the Accused had made full restitution of the tax undercharged prior to her pleading guilty.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relevant legislative provisions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The relevant provision of the GSTA is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>62.</b> – (1)    Any person who wilfully with intent to evade or to assist any other person to evade tax –</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    makes any false statement or entry in any return, claim or application made under this Act;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction –</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    pay a penalty assessed under section 48 of three times the amount of tax which was or would have been undercharged in consequence of the offence or which would have been undercharged if the offence had not been detected; and</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Does Chng Gim Huat establish a sentencing benchmark for s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offences?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I found that neither <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> nor <em>Loon Wai Yang</em> established sentencing benchmarks for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA. Turning first to <em>Chng Gim Huat</em>, the offence being considered was income tax evasion under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA. The Appellant in <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> had not been charged with offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA. I noted that the maximum sentence of imprisonment for offences under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA, up to three years imprisonment, and for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA, up to seven years imprisonment, were vastly different. In view of the disparity between the maximum sentences of imprisonment, I found that if <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> had established a benchmark sentence that that would have to be confined to offences under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA and could not establish a benchmark for offences under section 62(1)(b) of the GSTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In any case, I found that <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> did not establish a benchmark, even for section 96(1)(b) offences. I had made this finding in a number of cases, in particular, <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Song Cheng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25218-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGMC 50</a> and <em>Public Prosecutor v Lin Shaohua</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25248-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGMC 53</a> (both cases are pending the High Court’s decision). In <em>Abu Syed Chowdhury</em> Yong CJ, at [15] stated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “A “benchmark” is a sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every judge, ensuring consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. It is not cast in stone, nor does it represent an abdication of the judicial prerogative to tailor criminal sanctions to the individual offender. It instead provides <b>the focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can be accurately determined.</b> A good “benchmark” decision therefore lays down <b>carefully the parameters of its reasoning in order to allow future judges to determine what falls within the scope of the “norm”, and what exceptional situations justify a departure from it</b>”.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> [ <b>Emphasis added</b>] </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I found that for a decision to create a benchmark sentence it should meet the following two criteria, namely, that (1) the benchmark should provide a focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases <b>with differing degrees of culpability</b> can be determined. I found that the bolded phrase is the key requirement in that sentences should differ depending on the relative culpability of the offender vis-à-vis the benchmark sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     That (2) the benchmark should <b>lay down the parameters of its reasoning</b> so that future judges would be able to determine what falls within the norm of a benchmark and when to depart from it. I found that <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> did not encapsulate these criteria.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The appellant in <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> had appealed against his conviction and the sentence imposed for offences of tax evasion under section 96(1) ITA. Yong CJ disagreed with the appellant’s submission that he should be sentenced to a fine rather than a sentence of imprisonment. Yong CJ stated that the public interest was significant in tax evasion cases as the offences “were grave and were tantamount to a deliberate fraud on the State” and that the offences affect society as a whole resulting in the State’s revenue having to be made up by other taxpayers. In addition, he found tax evasion offences were often difficult to detect and as such he held that “a custodial sentence should normally be imposed in order to meet the needs of general deterrence”: see <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> at [107].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The appellant in <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> had with wilful intent to evade tax omitted to include a sum of $290,000 from his income tax return for YA1995 and a sum of $1,024.000 from his income tax return for YA1996, resulting in a global tax undercharged of $354,645.65 for the two YAs. Yong CJ allowed the Appellant’s appeal against sentence and reduced the sentences imposed by the Magistrate to one months’ imprisonment for the first charge and two months’ imprisonment for the second charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As I stated in <em>Tan Song Cheng</em> and <em>Lin Shaohua</em>, I found that Yong CJ had clearly stated that custodial sentences should be the norm for offences under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA, nonetheless I found that Yong CJ had not established a sentencing benchmark. He had not explicitly stated in <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> that the decision should be utilised as a sentencing benchmark.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Yong CJ had highlighted that sentencing considerations for offences under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA would include the level of premeditation, the quantum of tax evaded and the offender’s role in the offence: see <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> at [110] and [111]. However, he did not lay down parameters to determine how the harm caused by such offences should be calibrated nor did he list out factors that would affect an offender’s degree of culpability or the interplay between the harm caused and the culpability of the offender in determining the appropriate sentence.

Silke JA held in <em>Ma Lai Wu</em> at [747D – 747G]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “… We think that, in Hong Kong, … sentences of immediate custodial imprisonment should in future be imposed in the appropriate cases.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>It is necessary for a court to take into consideration when assessing the quantum of such sentence – and this list is not intended to be exhaustive – </em> <b><em>the time span of the offences, the systems and methods used to evade tax, where or not there was re-payment of the tax evaded, the amount of tax, the individual culpability of one or more defendants and the circumstances of each defendant</em></b>”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> [ <b>Emphasis added</b>] </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I found that these factors would equally be applicable when determining the appropriate sentence for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In <em>Loon Wai Yang</em>, Chua J had affirmed the District Court’s sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment for an offence under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA involving GST evaded amounting to approximately $41,000. It would appear from the decision that the Prosecution had discontinued their appeal against sentence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and, in relation to the Appellant’s appeal against sentence, Chua J held, at [49 to 50]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“49    As for the fifth charge, the DJ had sentenced the Appellant to three weeks’ imprisonment. … the amount of GST refund had been overstated by $41,252.65 …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    Before me, the Appellant accepted (in my view, correctly) that the sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment in respect of the fifth charge was not manifestly excessive. … I therefore dismissed the appeal against sentence in respect of the fifth charge.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As it would appear that the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence had been discontinued, Chua J would not have considered whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Chua J did not address the principles or factors to be applied when sentencing offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA, nor did he set out a sentencing framework. As such, I found that <em>Loon Wai Yang</em> did not establish a sentencing benchmark that would bind lower the lower courts. As <em>Loon Wai Yang</em> did not establish a benchmark sentence I did not think that I would be offending against the principle of respect, referred to by the Defence (see paragraph [24] above), by declining to follow <em>Loon Wai Yang</em> in imposing sentences of three weeks’ imprisonment for each of the three charges against the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Should the court adopt the Prosecution’s PSF? </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Is there consistency in the sentences imposed for s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offences in past cases?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As with my findings in <em>Tan Song Cheng</em> and <em>Lin Shaohua</em> with regard to offences under s 96(1)(b of the ITA, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that there was a need to re-consider how sentences for section 62(1)(b) of the GST were calibrated and it would be timely for the High Court to provide guidance on sentences for these offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents comprising 50 prosecutions under section 62(1)(b) from 2004 to 2019<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. Sentences imposed for the s 62(1)(b) offences ranged from a low of two weeks’ to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge. However, there did not appear to be <sub>a </sub>correlation between the length of the custodial sentence and the quantum of GST evaded or, to a lesser extent, the offender’s level of culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>PP v Chua Swee Kian Magdalene</em> (IRA-Sum Nos 56-96 of 2004)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> the offender was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $8,370. The offender had created false purchases and sales to foreign companies to support her claims. By comparison, offenders who had evaded larger GST amounts and had comparable or greater culpability were sentenced to relatively lighter terms of imprisonment. For example:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>PP v Tang Wai Kay</em> (IRA-Sum Nos 1-49 of 2006)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $64,933.43. The offender had forged invoices to mislead IRAS and had also not cooperated with IRAS over two years of the investigation.

The offender had set up a sham business with the sole intention of using the business to perpetuate GST fraud. The offender was also uncooperative with the IRAS during the investigation. Similarly, in view of the quantum of tax evaded and the offender’s culpability it would appear that the offender’s sentence was light in comparison to <em>Chau Swee Kian Magdalene.</em></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>PP v Seow Ming Liang</em> (IRA-Sum Nos 000107 – 000110-MSC-2012)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, the offender was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $35,670.39. The offender had created fictitious purchase invoices to support the offence. The amount of tax evaded was over four times greater than the amount in <em>Chau Swee Kian Magdalene</em> and yet the offender in this case was sentenced to a far more lenient sentence. I found that there was clear inconsistency in the sentences.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     In <em>PP v Chia Puay Yeoh</em> (IRA-Sum Nos. 342-344, 346, 349-350, 352-355-MSC-2013)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $40,905.57. The offender was the mastermind behind a “complex GST scam” that used multiple shell companies. Similarly, I found that in terms of the GST evaded and the culpability of the offender this case was far more egregious but that the sentence was relatively light when compared <em>Chau Swee Kian Magdalene</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The conclusion that I drew from the cases tendered in the Prosecution’s table of precedents was that, in terms of the relative culpability and harm, there is a lack of consistency in the sentences, that have been imposed since 2004. The Prosecution tendered a graph of the sentences against the quantum of GST evaded<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. The table starkly shows how there has been a lack of correlation between the length of custodial sentences and the amount of GST evaded.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     For instance, a similar sentence of five months’ imprisonment was imposed in both <em>PP v Li Xiangqing</em> (SC-908320-2017 &amp; Others)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> for evading GST amounting $1,044 and in <em>PP v Shyam Lekhraj Bhojwani</em> (IRA-Sum Nos. 50-55 of 2006) for evading GST amounting to $235,692.55. Whilst there were clearly differences in the level of culpability between the offenders in these two cases, the huge amount of GST evaded in <em>Shyam Lekhraj Bhojwani</em> would have warranted a far lengthier sentence when compared with the other precedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Thus, I agreed that there should be the development of a sentencing framework that would lay down the principles to be used in determining the appropriate sentence and which would utilise the full sentencing range available for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Utilising the full sentencing spectrum</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In <em>Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17081-SSP.xml')">[2014] 4 SLR 892</a>, Menon CJ held at [59] as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “… It is trite that the statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence and that the sentencing judge ought to note the maximum penalty imposed and then apply his mind to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament: <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0653.xml')">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653</a> (“Angliss”) at [86]. Put another way, <b>the court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence</b>: see <em>Ong Chee Eng v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0776.xml')">[2012] 3 SLR 776</a> at [24].”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> [ <b>Emphasis mine</b>] </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The maximum sentence of imprisonment for an offence under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA is seven years’ imprisonment. It was immediately clear from the Prosecution’s graph of sentences that the full sentencing spectrum has not been utilised<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The longest sentences that have been imposed have been sentences of 12 months’ and 18 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Prosecution’s PSF</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The appropriate forum for the adoption of the Prosecution’s PSF is the High Court. However, I was also of the view that as reliance on past-precedents to calibrate sentences for offences under s 62(1)(b) was inadequate that I could take guidance from the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in terms of the principle to be applied to determining an offender’s culpability and the level of harm of the offence. This was similar to the approach that I took in <em>Tan Song Cheng</em> and <em>Lin Shaohua</em> with the exception that, in the present case, I did not accept the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing matrix (see Step 2 at paragraph [17(b)] above) as I found that a sentence up to 14 months’ imprisonment where there is a low culpability and low harm appeared to be overly severe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the calibration of the appropriate sentences should be based on a harm-culpability analysis. I agreed with the factors that the Prosecution proposed should be considered with regard to harm and culpability. With regard to harm, I found that the primary harm caused by GST evasion was the deprivation of revenue due to the public coffers and the consequent loss that would arise as the tax could not be used for the benefit of society as a whole. The lost revenue would have to be made up by other taxpayers: see <em>Chng Gim Huat</em> at [107].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     However, I did find that whilst the quantum of tax evaded was the primary consideration in the level of harm caused by the offence, there should also be a consideration of the other harm factors, namely, whether the offence was syndicated, whether it was transnational or whether it undermined the Government. If these factors were absent, then the level of harm caused by the offence should similarly be adjusted downwards. I accepted the Prosecution’s list of factors affecting culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Based on the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents, it would appear that, based on a consideration of the GST evaded alone, the vast majority of charges for GST evasion under s 62(1)(b) would fall under level 1 harm on the proposed sentencing matrix. If, using the PSF, an offender was assessed to have low culpability and the offence involved level 1 harm, the possible sentence would nonetheless be up to 14 months’ imprisonment. As such, even for offences involving a relatively low level of GST evaded lengthy sentences of imprisonment would be the norm using the proposed matrix.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As such, I agreed with the Defence submission that pegging level 1 harm at GST evaded of $75,000 and below appeared to be arbitrary and would result in very stiff imprisonment sentences. In my opinion, it would have been preferrable to increase the quantum of GST evaded for a finding of level 1 harm.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I noted that the Prosecution’s application of the PSF would appear to acknowledge that the sentences to be imposed on the Accused calibrated after using the PSF would be harsh. For MSC-902212-2020, involving GST evaded amounting to $49,230.26, the Prosecution submitted that, based on level 1 harm and low culpability, the starting sentence should be 30 weeks’ imprisonment. A starting sentence of 30 weeks’ imprisonment would be approximately at the midway point of the range of up to 14 months’ imprisonment. A sentence of 30 weeks imprisonment would be far in excess of sentences imposed for the vast majority of precedents involving similar sums of tax evaded.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As stated above, the Prosecution appeared to have acknowledge this because they proposed a 50% reduction in the starting sentence after considering offender-specific factors, i.e. for MSC-902212-2020 the Prosecution proposed a sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment. I failed to see the justification in imposing a 50% discount after balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors. The mitigating factors, except for the fact that the Accused had made full restitution of the tax evaded, were not so remarkable as to warrant a 50% discount to the starting sentence, especially in light of the fact that there were 8 TIC charges. I inferred that the Prosecution proposed such a high discount because an application of the sentencing matrix would give rise to overly harsh sentences against the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For these reasons, in particular that I found that the sentencing matrix at Step 2 would result in very stiff sentences, I declined to apply the Prosecution's PSF.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appropriate sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I found that the Accused’s culpability was low. I agreed with the Prosecution that there was little planning or premeditation on the Accused’s part, that her method of evading GST was not particularly sophisticated and that her offences did not involve falsification of source documents. Based on the quantum of tax evaded and the Accused’s culpability I found that the following precedents were instructive:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)      <em>Tang Wai Kay</em> (see paragraph [45(a)] above): the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $64,933.43. I found that this case was more egregious than the present case in terms of the quantum of GST evaded as well as the offender’s culpability. As such, I found that the sentences for the charges faced by the Accused should not exceed three months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)      <em>Muhamad Sazali Bin Mohd Salleh</em> (see paragraph [45(b)] above): similarly I found that in terms of both the quantum of GST evaded and the culpability of the offender this precedent was more egregious than the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>PP v Tang Ee Boon</em> (IRA Sum Nos. 000039-000041 &amp; Others of 2010), for one of the charges the offender had evaded GST amounting to $34,472.94 and was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for that charge. The offender’s culpability, based on the details in the table of precedents, was, like the Accused in the present case, low. As such, I found that the sentence imposed in this precedent was instructive in determining the sentence to imposed against the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_d"></a>(d)      <em>Chia Puay Yeoh</em> (see paragraph [45(d)] above), the offender had a far higher level of culpability as compared to the Accused. The offender had been involved in a complex GST scam, had carried out his scheme using multiple companies and had enlisted the help of accomplices to carry out the scam. As such, I found that the individual sentences to be imposed for the charges faced by the Accused should not exceed the three months’ imposed in <em>Chia Puay Yeoh</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_e"></a>(e)      <em>Loon Wai Yang</em>: I found that although the quantum of GST evaded of $41,252.65 was comparable with the quantum of GST evaded by the Accused, I found that the sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment imposed in <em>Loon Wai Yang</em> to be low and not in keeping with the sentences in the precedent cases.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In assessing the appropriate sentence I considered that there were eight TIC charges. The TIC charges disclosed that the Accused had started evading GST from July 2013 and that her offending continued until October 2016. This was a considerable period of time. The total GST evaded (including the TIC charges) was $226,902.56 and this was not an insignificant amount. I found that the TIC charges would warrant an uplift in the sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     With regards to mitigation, I gave credit to the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the first possible opportunity and that this was indicative of her remorse. I also gave credit to the fact that the Accused was a first-time offender, that she had cooperated with IRAS in its investigations and, significantly, that she had repaid fully the evaded GST.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Taking into account the quantum of tax evaded, the Accused’s culpability and the aggravating and mitigation factors I found that the appropriate sentences would be eight weeks’ imprisonment for MSC-902212-2020 (GST evaded of $49,230.26) and six weeks’ imprisonment for MSC-902209-2020 (GST evaded of $29,928.85) and for MSC-902211-2020 (GST evaded of 428,751.90). I ordered that MSC-902212-2020 and MSC 902209-2020 should run consecutively. The global sentence I imposed was 14 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I found that a global sentence of 14 weeks’ imprisonment for the GSTA offences was not disproportionate to the scale of the Accused’s offending and it was not a crushing sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Paragraph 6 of the SOF.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>See Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions - Annex C - S.62(1) GSTA Precedents</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>There was no reference in the High Court decision to the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>See Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C – s 62(1) GSTA Precedents</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Sno. 1 of the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C – s 62(1) GSTA Precedents</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Sno 4 of the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C – s 62(1) GSTA Precedents</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>Sno. 11 of the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C – s 62(1) GSTA Precedents</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Sno. 21 of the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C – s 62(1) GSTA Precedents</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>Sno. 31 of the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C – s 62(1) GSTA Precedents</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>See PP v Pua Om Tee – Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C Graph</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>Sno. 47 of the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C – s 62(1) GSTA Precedents</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>See PP v Pua Om Tee – Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions – Annex C Graph</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap5 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
