Seven of the ten charges were for Cheating under Section 417 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed (“Penal Code”). Two of the ten charges were for Criminal Intimidation under Section 506 of the Penal Code and one charge was for an offence under the Films Act, Chapter 107, 1998 Rev Ed (“Films Act”). There are 26 other charges for various offences under the Penal Code and the Films Act to be taken into consideration for sentence (“TIC charges”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution has submitted for a total sentence of <u>at least</u> 30 months’ imprisonment. The Defence Counsel is asking for a sentence of <u>no more than</u> 24 months of imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Brief Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eleven female victims in this case and the <em>modus operandi</em> (“MO”) or the manner of deception on the victims was similar. The Offender admitted to the commission of the 36 offences in the period between April 2015 and February 2016. In 2015, the Offender wanted to look for paid sex, but could not afford the prices stated in the online advertisements that he viewed. He came up with an idea to advertise on an online classifieds website, for ‘sugar babes’, <em>i.e.</em> paid escorts who also provided sexual services to “sugar daddies” in exchange for money. In his advertisement, the Offender falsely represented that he was “a freelance agent” that “<em>provide sugarbabes to well to do clients</em>”; and that “<em>if you are serious about earning good money I have the clients for you!</em>” He provided a phone number in the advertisement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From April 2015 to January 2016, the Offender made the same representation to at least 11 female victims (from the ages of 18 to 24 at that time) who responded to the advertisement. The Offender told them that he had clients who could pay them $8,000 to $20,000 per month in order to capture their interest. He also told them that, in order to successfully secure a ‘sugar daddy’ arrangement with these clients, they had to send their nude photographs to the Offender, have photographs taken of them in the nude, and/or engage in sexual conduct with the Offender, which were filmed by him on some occasions. He further deceived the victims that these acts were necessary so that the victims could be ‘evaluated’ by his clients to assess their suitability for the ‘sugar daddy’ arrangement. In truth, he did not have any such clients and made these false representations to engage in sexual activity with the women without needing to pay them. In order to convince his victims of this deception, he created chat conversations which appeared to be between himself and his clients.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Public Prosecutors (“DPPs”) have put up a written Skeletal Submissions on Sentence providing their bases for a fair and reasonable sentence for which they suggested should be at least 30 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosecution set out, <em>inter alia</em>, the following factors and circumstances:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Premeditation and planning</em>. Over a period of 10 months, the Offender executed a carefully thought-out scheme and deceived unsuspecting young women into engaging in sexual activity with him. The offences were highly premeditated, well planned and executed. There was a systematic approach to induce the victims to engage in sexual acts with him and allowing him to take intimate photographs and/or videos of them.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Number of victims.</em> With the MO he had adopted of pretending to be an agent for wealthy clients, he engaged in various sexual acts with at least 11 victims, five of them on multiple occasions.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two of the victims tried to sever ties with him, he threatened to disseminate the recordings he had made of their sexual acts unless they engaged in sexual activity with him again. The threats of disseminating a person’s nude photographs has the propensity to cause a great degree of distress and humiliation to the victims, given the ease of circulating such images on the internet and the almost impossible task of eradicating them.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offences were committed for self-gratification.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation &amp; Defence’s Submissions on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Counsel (“DC”) has put up on behalf of the Offender a comprehensive Plea in Mitigation and I will not repeat the detailed submissions here except for the key points.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence raised, <em>inter alia</em>, the following mitigating factors:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offender is genuinely very remorseful. He had cooperated fully with the authorities and had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. By pleading guilty, he has saved the victims from the trauma of having to testify in court.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims were aware that the photographs and video recordings were taken. The offences did not result from an abuse of trust or power. The victims had opportunities to assess their situations and reject his requests. The women could not be said to be particularly vulnerable victims.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offender has no criminal record.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offender was suffering from Adjustment Disorder which was a significant contributory factor to the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_e"></a>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offender has a strong propensity for reform.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence urged the court to have full regard to the facts and the extent of the criminality of the Offender. Based on the personal factors and the sentencing considerations raised in the Plea in Mitigation, the Defence submitted that a total sentence of imprisonment of not more than 24 months would be fair and just.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Considerations</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed to consider the sentences I intend to pass in this case, it is important to be reminded that the total sentence to be passed has to be commensurate with the gravity of the offences and the circumstances in which they were committed, bearing in mind the type of offender before me.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offender before me for sentencing is a “multiple offender”. In the case of <em>PP v Raveen Balakrishnan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22604-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 799</a> (“<em>Raveen</em>”), Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon used the description of “multiple offender” at [36] of that judgment to describe an offender who is to be sentenced for convictions on multiple offences. In <em>Raveen</em>, CJ Menon derived an analytical framework for sentencing a multiple offender. A summary of the relevant principles in that framework can be found at [98] of that judgment. The first stage of the sentencing analysis is to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence. The second stage is to determine how the individual sentences should run. The third stage is to apply the Totality Principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the principal sentencing consideration for this case is Deterrence. Furthermore, the sentencing principle of Retribution is also relevant in view of the harm suffered by the eleven victims.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Individual sentences for this case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the calibration of the appropriate sentence for each offence, it is to be borne in mind that the Offender has no criminal antecedents, had cooperated with the police and has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. This has obviated the need for the victims to testify in court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My calibration of the individual sentences is within those proposed by the DPPs and the DC, except for the sentence to be passed for the offence under the Films Act. The factors relevant to the calibration of the sentences for the offences of Cheating under Section 417 and Criminal Intimidation under Section 506 of the Penal Code were largely not in dispute. The calibration has also taken into account the need to utilize the full spectrum of the punishment provided for the offences in question.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the following steps in calibrating the individual sentences for this case at the first stage of the sentencing approach in <em>Raveen</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine the sentencing starting point for each convicted charge solely on the facts for that charge.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider any uplift for each convicted charge on account of the relevant TIC charges connected to it.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentences for the Section 417 offences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the seven offences of Cheating under Section 147 of the Penal Code, I had considered the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_"></a>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the sentencing precedent of <em>PP v Syed Zainuddin Bin Syed Salim</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6669-M.xml')">[2002] SGDC 293</a> cited by both the Prosecution and Defence, I found the suggested range of imprisonment, in the region of 7 to 9 months for each charge, to be acceptable. Admittedly, this is a rough and ready gauge, based only on one case under the old provision, for which the maximum punishment is an imprisonment of one year. This range of 7 to 9 months per charge can only serve as a starting point or more accurately, a baseline sentence for cases involving cheating to obtain sexual gratification.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2__1"></a>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, an uplift was worked into the individual sentence to account for the TIC charges, the number of times that the criminal acts were repeated on the same victim (for which sentences could be run concurrently) and any other offence-specific factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I calibrated the following individual sentences against the Offender for the offences of Cheating under Section 417 of the Penal Code:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="24.56%" /> <col width="31%" /> <col width="44.44%" /> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Charge No. DAC</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sentence of imprisonment</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903739/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">10 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Related to the sentence for Section 506 offence of the same victim in DAC 903740/2020</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903744/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Related to the sentence for Section 506 offence of the same victim in DAC 903747/2020 </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903749/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">7 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">No related charges for and no TIC charges of the same victim</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903751/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two other Section 417 charges TIC (same victim): </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 903752/2020</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 903753/2020</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903759/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Another Section 417 charges TIC (same victim): </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 903770/2020 </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903765/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two other Section 417 charges TIC (same victim): </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 903764/2020</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 903766/2020</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903769/2019</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Another Section 417 charge TIC (same victim):</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 903770/2020</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left" /> <br clear="left" /> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calibrating the individual sentences as shown in the table, I have factored in the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner by which the Offender went about cheating the women into agreeing to perform the sexual acts demonstrated a high degree of culpability. The Offender’s MO was well thought-out. The Offender manipulated the victims by preying on their gullibility. He carefully made up details of his wealthy clients and then induced the victims with false pretences of perks being offered by his non-existent rich clients.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offender convinced the victims that he had to record the sexual acts, in order to promote them to his clients. When he was able to obtain a recording of one victim, he would use that to convince subsequent victims of his claims that they had to be “tested” by him for his clients.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the high level of culpability, the level of harm in this case is also high, both in terms of the number of victims totalling eleven and the psychological harm caused. The psychological harm caused was obvious from the medical report on one of the victims. Several victims were exploited more than once.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of victims in this case is also a factor calling for a significant sentence. As submitted by the Prosecution, the courts have considered certain victims to be vulnerable by virtue of the fact that they are not likely to report the wrongdoing to the authorities. This is for reasons of fear and shame in the event that they are identified or have to testify. The risk of ridicule for being gullible and the moral stigma attached to such victims of sexual exploitation is high.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_e"></a>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence of Cheating under Section 417 of the Penal Code is punishable with up to 3 years’ imprisonment. This means that a deterrent and significant sentence <em>for a single charge</em> of this offence with the facts and factors of this case, should be around 9 to 18 months, to have that salutary effect without being excessive.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence for the Section 506 offences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calibrating the sentences for the two Criminal Intimidation offences proceeded with, I have taken into account the following pertinent matters:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence is under the more serious limb of Section 506 of the Penal Code for Criminal Intimidation with a threat to impute unchastity to a woman, which is punishable with imprisonment of up to 10 years.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threats to disseminate and sell the nude photos of the female victims are very serious offences. The potential of causing a great degree of distress and humiliation to the victims cannot be overstated.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two charges of Criminal Intimidation proceeded with by the Prosecution, for which the Offender has been convicted of, involved two different aims. One was to stop the victim from reporting to the police, the other one was to get another victim to pay him $2,000. These intentions of the Offender made the offences more serious than the TIC charge of criminal intimidation to cause alarm to the victim. Therefore, an imprisonment term in the range of 6 to 12 months for each charge is warranted. The suggested range is in line with similar precedent cases as cited by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the sentences are calibrated as follows for the offences under Section 506 of the Penal Code:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="20.54%" /> <col width="27.64%" /> <col width="51.82%" /> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Charge No. DAC</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sentence</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903740/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">7 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Related to the sentence for a Section 417 offence of the same victim in DAC 903739/2020 </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">903747/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Related to the sentence for a Section 417 offence of the same victim in DAC 903744/2020 and another Section 506 charge TIC (same victim): DAC 903746/2020</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left" /> <br clear="left" /> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence for the offence under the Films Act</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution and Defence have proposed custodial sentences for the offence under Section 29(1)(a) of the Films Act for making an obscene film. The offence is punishable with a fine of not less than $20,000 but not more than $40,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. In coming up with the sentence for this offence, it is important to bear in mind the gravamen of the charge and the type of punishments stipulated in the law for that offence. In my view, we mustn’t be unfair to the Offender and view this offence in the shadow of the Cheating and Criminal Intimidation offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing to note is that the obscene film in this case was made with the knowledge of the victim. In fact, for this offence under the Films Act, there is strictly speaking no victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided that the punishment for this offence under the Films Act should more appropriately be a high fine, bearing in mind the 14 other charges under the Films Act that the Offender had consented to be taken into consideration for sentence. Therefore, I have decided to impose a fine of $20,000 for the offence in DAC 903743/2020. A sentence of one month’s imprisonment is to be served in default of payment of the fine.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Psychiatric condition of the Offender</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence has put forward as a mitigating factor the psychiatric condition of the Offender. I was not able to give any significant weight to the psychiatric condition for the following reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offender only consulted the psychiatrist in 2020, which is about five years after the commission of the offences. There is no medical record of the Offender from around the time when the offences were committed, suffering any diagnosed mental condition affecting him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the offences were committed were highly premeditated. There was clear manipulation of victims whom he knew were highly susceptible to promises of substantial monetary gains. Careful steps were taken to put up a convincing fa&ccedil;ade to deceive the victims.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighed against the seriousness of the offences and the manipulative methods employed by the Offender, the plea for a lenient sentence based on his psychiatric condition is totally misplaced and deserved little consideration and weight.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Number of Sentences to run consecutively</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key sentencing issue in this case which I disagree with the common position taken by the Prosecution and the Defence is in the number of sentences to be ordered to run consecutively. The DPPs and the DC submitted that only three sentences ought to run consecutively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier on the sentencing approach in <em>Raveen</em>, there are three stages in sentencing a multiple offender. The first stage is the consideration of the individual sentences, which I have done. The second stage is to decide whether the offences are unrelated. As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences which form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed. CJ Menon held in <em>Raveen</em> that: “…as a general rule, a multiple offender who had committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.” (at Paragraph 41).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, there were 36 offences committed and 11 victims. Of the 10 charges proceeded with, there are 9 custodial sentences being imposed. Out of the 9 sentences of imprisonment passed, there are 7 victims involved. If not for the operation of the Totality Principle and the Aggregation Principle in sentencing, it would be right to order 7 of the 9 sentences with imprisonment terms to run consecutively. This is because these 9 offences with imprisonment terms were committed against 7 different victims. The Offender might have used a common MO to deceive the 7 different victims but that should not be used as a reason for not subjecting the Offender to consecutive punishment in respect of each victim. Using a common MO does not mean that the offences committed by the Offender are to be considered as parts of a single transaction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stage is to apply the Totality Principle to ensure that the aggregate sentence is proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality. If an aggregate sentence is considered excessive, the sentencing court may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences. As spelt out in the case of <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a>, the Totality Principle is a principle of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality. If I were to order 7 sentences to run consecutively, it would result in a global sentence of 57 months of imprisonment. Such a total sentence would infringe the second limb of the Totality Principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second limb of the Totality Principle considers whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects. The Offender has no criminal antecedents and is remorseful. A sentence of 57 months (which is 4 years and 9 months) might be seen as crushing and not in keeping with his clean record.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had endeavoured to apply the analytical framework of <em>Raveen</em> in sentencing the Offender before me, taking care to observe all the relevant principles enunciated therein, including in particular the Aggregation Principle, which was mentioned in <em>Raveen</em> and then reiterated in the Court of Appeal case of <em>Muhammad Sutarno Bin Nasir v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22011-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGCA 43</a> <em>(“Sutarno”)</em>. The Aggregation Principle was referred to in <em>Sutarno’s case</em> as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“… The aggregation principle recognizes the fact that aggregation in such cases may result in a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the overall criminality of the case, and that longer sentences may induce feelings of hopelessness that destroy the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration. …” (at Paragraph 24).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give effect to the Aggregation Principle, I have decided to run only 5 out of the 9 sentences of imprisonment consecutively instead of 7. This would reflect the proper punishment for the Offender’s criminality vis-&agrave;-vis the number of victims (in the charges proceeded with) who were deceived and exploited by him without infringing the Totality and Aggregation Principles.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominant sentencing principle in this case is Deterrence. The total sentence imposed for the offences committed by the Offender in this case properly reflect his overall criminality. There is also the operation of the principle of Retribution for the harm caused to the 11 victims. The overall sentence takes into account the need for both general and specific deterrence with the running of five sentences of imprisonment consecutively to adhere to the Aggregation Principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case is mainly about Cheating for Sex with 18 of the 36 charges <em>i.e</em>. half of the total number of charges being offences under Section 417 of the Penal Code. The deception and exploitation of the eleven female victims to gratify the sexual desires of the Offender, with an elaborate and well-executed plan over a period of 10 months, make such offences particularly deserving of punishment at the higher end of sentences to be meted out for the offences of Cheating under Section 417 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, after taking into account all the relevant factors, including the charges to be taken into consideration, the following sentences are
