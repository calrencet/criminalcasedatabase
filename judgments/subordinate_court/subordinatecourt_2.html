<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Accused, Teo Chiah Hou, 25 years old, claimed trial to a charge of insulting the modesty of a woman (“<b>the Victim</b>”) by exposing his penis and stroking it with his right hand, intending that such gesture be seen by her, an offence punishable under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The alleged incident took place on 24 January 2018 at about 7.00pm in a motor car bearing registration number SLE6502J, driven by the Accused and where the Victim was his front seat passenger.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the material time, the Accused who was in possession of a Private Hire Licence, rented the car and moon-lighted as a Grab Car and Grab Hitch driver. The Victim had booked a Grab Hitch ride from the Accused and the alleged offence took place during the journey.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and accordingly, I found the Accused guilty of the charge. He was sentenced to <b>four (4) weeks’ imprisonment</b>. The Accused being dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence filed an appeal against both conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       These are the grounds for my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The proceeded charge read as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>MCN 9021290 of 2018</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You, Teo Chiah Hou, are charged that you, on 24 January 2018, at about 7 p.m., in a motor car bearing registration number SLE6502J, in Singapore, did make a gesture intending to insult the modesty of a woman, one [<em>name of victim</em>], <em>to wit</em>, by exposing your penis and stroking it with your right hand, intending that such gesture be seen by the said [<em>victim</em>], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The undisputed facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The facts of the case were largely undisputed between the parties. At the material time, the Accused was working as a sales engineer in Philips Singapore. He rented a car and was moon-lighting as a Grab Car and Grab Hitch driver.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 24 January 2018, at about 6.00pm, the Victim booked a Grab Hitch ride from the Accused to pick her up at Circular Road to Blk 135 Cashew Road, her boyfriend’s home.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Sometime between 6.48pm and 7.02pm, the Accused picked the Victim up in a Nissan Latio, vehicle number SLE6502J. What transpired in the car after the Accused had picked the Victim up was the subject matter of the trial. During the journey, at about 7.05pm, the Victim sent a text message to her boyfriend (“<b>Adam</b>”) informing him that she was going to call the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Suffice to note at this juncture, the journey was discontinued mid-way when the Victim requested that the Accused drop her off at Royal Plaza on Scotts instead of her intended destination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     This took place sometime between 7.10pm to 7.13pm. It was also not disputed that after the Victim had alighted from the Accused’s car, the Accused sent her 2 text messages at about 7.15pm and 7.17pm respectively. In the text messages, the Accused apologised to the Victim and thanked her for letting him “realize his mistake”. He further apologised to the Victim for the inconvenience and said that “I’ll never do it again”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For easy reference, the two text messages (“the apology text messages”) are reproduced below.</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="12.5%"/> <col width="13.16%"/> <col width="61.86%"/> <col width="12.48%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Time</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>From</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Message</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Exhibit</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7.15pm </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Rly sorry and thank you for letting me realize my mistake </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P1-9 </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7.17pm </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">And so sorry for the inconvenience, I’ll never do it again. </p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P1-9 </p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Victim did not reply to the Accused’s messages. She booked a Grab Share ride to her boyfriend’s office at Eng Hoon Street, Tiong Bahru, to meet him. They spent the rest of the evening together, thinking about how to handle the situation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Victim eventually lodged a police report the next evening on 25 January 2018 at about 9.31pm at the Bukit Panjang South NPP (exhibit P4).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Case for the Prosecution</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The prosecution’s main witness was the Victim (PW2).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of the Victim (PW2) </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     At the material time, the Victim was 23 years old. She was studying full time and working part-time for events. She testified that on the day in question, she had an appointment at Circular Road which ended in the evening. She booked a Grab Hitch to go to her boyfriend’s house at 135 Cashew Road.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Grab Hitch is a social ride-sharing to match journeys between private car drivers and commuters heading the same way at the same time. It is essentially a social carpooling service where drivers choose to share their rides with passengers and get paid a basic fare that covered their petrol costs. The passengers pay a cheaper rate for the ride as compared to alternative private transport options such as regular Grab Car or taxi.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Victim testified that she booked the Grab Hitch ride at about 6 plus in the evening and the Accused texted her to look out for a lavender colour car. When the car arrived, she sat at the front passenger seat out of courtesy for the driver. There were no other passengers in the car. She explained that Grab Hitch was like a private hire and some drivers do not like it when their passengers sit at the back seat as if they were regular Grab drivers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Victim testified that everything seemed normal at the start of the car ride. About 5 minutes into the ride, she noticed out of the corner of her eye that the Accused was doing something with his hand. She assumed that he was fidgeting with his seatbelt. This continued for a few minutes and out of curiosity, she tilted her head to glance at what the driver was doing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     She saw that the Accused’s penis was out his pants and he was stroking his penis with his fingers in a up and down motion. His left hand was on the steering wheel, and the Victim could see that at least the top half of the penis was exposed and uncovered. At that point, she realised that the accused was masturbating. She was shocked and looked away.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Victim further testified that in order to make sure of what she thought she had seen, she tilted her head again a few seconds later to take a second look. She saw the same thing and she felt nervous, scared and taken aback.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     When asked if it was possible that the driver was actually doing something else, such as scratching himself, the Victim testified that she remembered that he was stroking his penis and that she did not register what she had seen as scratching. She maintained that she was absolutely sure that what she saw was the Accused’s penis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Victim then took a screenshot on the Grab phone application which displayed the driver’s name, photo and the car details in case she decided to lodge a police report. As she was afraid that the driver would behave aggressively or negatively, she initiated a conversation with him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     During the conversation, the Accused periodically covered his penis with his hand. She was not sure if he continued masturbating. She did not see him fasten or zip his clothing. According to her, the Accused did not show any aggression, anger or any signs that she should be worried about.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At some point, the Victim found courage to confront the Accused. She asked him about his girlfriend, whose picture she saw in the background of his phone. She asked him “Why can’t you settle this with her?” and “Is the first time you are doing this to a girl?”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Victim testified that while the Accused initially feigned ignorance, he later replied to the Victim that “Yes, this is my first time.” He also apologised. When the Victim told the Accused that she could report him to the police and it would badly affect his future, the Accused became very apologetic and apologised to her again, and said that he would never do it again. Based on the Victim’s understanding, the Accused was apologising to her for his actions of masturbating in front of her.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     However, as the Victim felt uncomfortable, she asked the Accused to drop her off at Royal Plaza on Scotts which he did at about 7.13 pm. The whole car ride lasted about 15 to 20 minutes. After she alighted from the Accused’s car, she immediately called her boyfriend, Adam and told him what happened. The Accused also sent her the two apology text messages at 7.15pm and 7.17pm respectively which she did not reply. The Victim then booked another ride to Adam’s office and they thought about how to handle the situation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Later, the Victim and Adam managed to find the Accused’s girlfriend’s social media account and wanted to reach out to her. They decided that if the Accused apologised to them in front of his girlfriend and his family, they would forgive him. The Victim explained that if the Accused admitted to his mistake in front of his family and girlfriend, they could look out for him and make sure that he did not repeat the same mistake and he could probably change.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Victim eventually decided to lodge a police report when the Accused’s girlfriend did not believe the Victim when she told her what had happened in the car. During her testimony, the Victim explained that she did not tag the Accused or expose him on social media, neither did she mention on social media that she was a victim in that situation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     She confirmed that prior to 24 January 2018, she did not know the Accused and she has not heard of him or seen him before. She affirmed that she has no reason to make up allegations against the Accused. She further explained that she has never filed a police report against any person before, and that she did not want such a thing to happen to any other girls.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     During cross-examination by the learned Defence Counsel, it was put to the Victim that it was drizzling on that evening, and when she boarded the Accused’s car, she was wearing a pullover with a hood over her head. She disagreed with the learned counsel that she was hooded throughout the journey, and that the only time the Accused had a look at her face was after she had alighted from the car and turned to speak to him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     She agreed with the learned Counsel that during the journey, the Accused was not driving recklessly in terms of his speed or in the way he manoeuvred his car. She remembered that when he picked her up, it was still bright but was she unsure whether he had switched on the headlights of the car. She also did not observe whether the driver had signalled his intentions before executing turns, or see him operate the wiper switch.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     When asked if she could have just turned on the camera on her phone since she was texting her boyfriend to capture what the driver was doing, the Victim agreed. However, she explained that it was not every day that one was prepared to be in such a situation. She did not know if the driver might have any mental issues or whether he could get aggressive or angry. She further explained during re-examination that if she were to point a camera at the Accused and he saw this, it would have pissed him off as he would have known that she had captured the evidence on the spot and that could trigger him off.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Victim disagreed that her text conversations with her boyfriend when she was in the car and assuring him that she was fine, despite his worry about what had happened, was inconsistent with someone who had been shown a penis and whose modesty was insulted.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     During re-examination, she explained that while she was in a way harassed, confused and a little worried, she also realised from her conversation with the Accused that he was not aggressive towards her and he was actually apologetic. She knew that she was safe and that the Accused would not touch her or lay his hands on her or be any way physical. That was the reason why she texted her boyfriend that she was fine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     When questioned extensively by the Defence Counsel about the Accused’s clothing, including what shirt, pants, or shoes he was wearing, and the colour of his underwear, the Victim testified that she could not remember. She also did not see the Accused inserting his right hand into his pants to pull out his penis. The Victim explained during re-examination that when she boarded the car, she usually would not take a very detailed look at the driver or notice the driver’s clothing. There was a chance that the Accused’s pants were unzipped and his penis was already showing but she did not realise this only until after she looked twice.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     During cross-examination, it was put to the Victim that the Accused might have unconsciously scratched himself at his crotch because of his medical condition of hives, and he could have been embarrassed when she saw him scratched at the area. In response, the Victim explained that she would not have seen him masturbating his penis if he were scratching an itch. She further elaborated that the Accused never mentioned to her about any itch, discomfort or being apologetic over a scratch. As such, this thought did not cross her mind at all.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Victim was also questioned about the police report that she lodged on 25 January 2018 at about 9.31pm (exhibit P4). When asked why she did not make the police report after alighting from the Accused’s car, the Victim explained that before she made the police report, she had decided that if the Accused admitted to his mistake, she would give him another chance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     She agreed with the learned Counsel that she did not mention the word “masturbation” in the police report, and that she had only mentioned that the driver used his hand “to continuously touch his penis which was exposed”. During re-examination, she explained that she felt shy and awkward and it was uncomfortable for her to use the word at the police station or in the car with the Accused. However, as it has been two years since the incident, she was more than confident enough to use the word.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Victim also disagreed with the learned Defence Counsel that she felt short-changed because she was charged $9 for the journey that she did not complete, and she reported to Grab company and lodged the police report only after the Accused made a police report against her and her boyfriend. The Victim clarified that she was not aware that the Accused had filed a police report about the incident. She only found this out during Mr Wee’s cross-examination.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of the Victim’s boyfriend, Adam (PW3)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The prosecution led evidence from the Victim’s boyfriend, Adam that when he received the message from his girlfriend at about 7.05pm saying that she was going to call the police, he did not know what had happened. He was very worried for the Victim as he had never received such a message from her. He only learned about what happened after she alighted from the car and called him immediately to tell him what happened.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I do not propose to go into the details of Adam’s evidence about what the Victim had told him. However, I would observe that what the Victim had told Adam was largely consistent with her evidence in court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Adam also testified that when the Victim spoke to him over the phone and was describing what had happened, she sounded very shocked. He explained that it was like her adrenaline was running and she was very hyper and in disbelief. However, after a while, she was back to her normal self.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     After Adam obtained the driver’s information from the Victim, he decided to call the Accused to speak to him. He testified that during the phone call, he asked the Accused whether the Accused thought that he could show his penis to his passenger and get away with it. When Adam threatened to call the police, the Accused started apologising.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     When asked if it was possible that the Accused was apologising for something else such as scratching his inner thigh, Adam replied that if that was the case, the Accused would not be afraid of admitting to that in front of his parents or for the Victim to make a police report.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Adam texted the Accused a screenshot of the vehicle details, booking page, and the text conversation the Victim had with the Accused prior to boarding his car. After sending the images, Adam texted the accused and told him that he had one hour to tell his parents or else he would call the police. Adam wanted to give the Accused an ultimatum to apologise in front of his parents for masturbating in the car.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This followed a series of text messages between Adam and the Accused. In a message sent at about 7.42pm, the Accused replied to Adam that he could not make it in an hour but he just wanted to sincerely apologise for what had happened earlier on. He felt really guilty and will never repeat it. He asked to be given a chance as he was still young. He would not want his career or future to be ruined. The Accused further said in the message that it was really a harsh mistake. He apologised and hope that they could put this incident away.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For easy reference, the said message is reproduced below:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="12.4775044991002%"/> <col width="13.1573685262947%"/> <col width="60.0879824035193%"/> <col width="14.2771445710858%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Time</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>From</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Message</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Exhibit</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7.42pm </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">I cmi in an hr time for that, but i just wna sincerely apologize to what had happened earlier on.

The Accused begged Adam for forgiveness and said that he did not want to disappoint his loved ones because of his one-time mistake. The Accused repeatedly pleaded for their forgiveness and to be given a chance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In a message sent at about 7.51pm, the Accused asked if Adam could let him go this time and said that he was really sorry to have done that and he was really so guilty and sorry. However, Adam replied that he would either call the police or meet the Accused’s parents and fiancée, and for the Accused to choose which of the two options.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Adam further testified that taking all the messages together, the Accused was apologising for masturbating in front of the Victim in the car. He further confirmed that in the course of his conversation with the Accused, the Accused never mentioned that he was itchy or had rashes or had hives, neither did the Accused give any reason for having exposed his penis to his passenger.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     During cross-examination, it was put to Adam that the Accused was a person who would apologise even if he was not in the wrong. Despite Adam’s persistence, the Accused never admitted that he had exposed his penis to the Victim. However, the witness explained that even if the Accused was an apologetic person by nature even though he did not do anything wrong, there was no reason why the Accused would be afraid of them making a police report.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The learned Defence Counsel further put to Adam that the reason why he was so persistent was because he wanted the Accused to admit that he had exposed his penis to the Victim. However, the witness clarified that his motivation was that he wanted the Accused’s girlfriend to know the truth and not that he was trying to extract a confession from him. He maintained that if the Accused had told his loved ones and his family the truth, they would not have made a police report.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     At the close of the prosecution’s case, I found that the prosecution has made out a case against the Accused and accordingly, the Accused was called upon to enter his defence. The Accused elected to give evidence. He further called three other witnesses to testify in his defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Case for the Defence </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of the Accused (DW1)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The defence of the Accused was one of pure denial. The Accused disputed the material allegations made against him by the Victim, and in particular, what had transpired in the car.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Accused testified that on the afternoon of 24 January 2018, he collected the vehicle, a Nissan Latio from the car rental agency. Prior to that, he had rented a Honda Stream, an MPV which he found to consume too much fuel and the daily rental rate was too high. As such, he changed the vehicle to a smaller sedan with a lower rental fee.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Accused went home for lunch and after lunch, he drove to the Grab office located at Sin Ming to register his new vehicle. He decided to test out the new vehicle and drove the Grab Car. He managed to pick up a passenger from Bishan to the River Valley area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It was about 6.00pm and raining heavily, and there was a lot of traffic congestion on the roads. The Accused intended to head to his fiancée, Xue Qi’s home for dinner. He switched from the Grab Car to the Grab Hitch function on the Grab mobile application, which allowed him to select a passenger that was going in the same direction or destination. He accepted the Victim’s request as the pickup address and the intended destination was most suitable for him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     He explained that when he accepted a Grab Hitch ride request, the information made available to him of the Grab Hitch passenger details were the pickup address, intended destination, total number of passengers, estimated fare, thumbnail photo and gender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     When the Accused arrived at Circular Road to pick up the Victim, he observed that she was wearing a grey colour hoodie jacket. She had her hood covering over her head due to the heavy rain as she got into the vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Accused testified that after she boarded the vehicle, he asked her if she was headed to Bukit Panjang and if the air-conditioning was alright for her. She did not say anything to him and the remainder of the journey from Circular Road was made in silence until they were at Orchard Boulevard beside ION Orchard area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Accused testified that the Victim started to ask the Accused in English “<em>What are you doing?</em>”, “<em>Don’t think I don’t know what you are doing</em>”. To which, the Accused replied “<em>Huh? I driving what?”.</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Victim then went on to say, “<em>You have a girlfriend, right</em>?” to which the Accused replied “<em>Yes. Why</em>?”. Whereupon the Victim stated, “<em>Don’t you think it’s unfair to your girlfriend?</em>”. The Accused was stunned by these statements. He remained silent and did not know what to reply and was focusing on driving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As the Accused completed the right turn at Wheelock Place, the Victim told him that she was feeling uncomfortable and wanted to be dropped off nearby. The Accused asked her “<em>Why? What happened</em>?” to which the Victim replied “<em>Nothing</em>”. The Accused then suggested that he drop her off at Royal Plaza on Scotts and the Victim agreed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Victim alighted from the vehicle at Royal Plaza on Scotts. However, before she closed the car door, she turned and looked at the Accused and said, “<em>If you are going to do this again, it will ruin your future</em>”. She then closed the car door and left.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Accused testified that before the Victim alighted, she looked very angry. He had never encountered such a situation before and so he was a little worried. He then stopped his vehicle at the side, took out his handphone and sent her the two apology text messages. He explained that he did not want the passenger to give him a poor rating and affect his Grab rating as this could affect his incentive payment if his rating dropped below a rating of 4.8.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     After sending the messages to the Victim, the Accused activated the “End Journey” button to complete the trip on the Grab mobile application and received payment. He then made his way to his fiancée’s house.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     When asked by his learned counsel whether he did anything which he had to apologise for, and what was it that he agreed never to do again, the Accused explained that being in the sales line, service was of paramount importance to him. As long as he saw that a customer was unsatisfied or upset, he would apologise, regardless of whether he was in the wrong or not.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     He further explained that he was thanking his passenger for letting him know a mistake, although he was not sure what the mistake was about. As for apologising for the inconvenience caused, the Accused explained that he was referring to letting the Victim alight at the Royal Plaza on Scotts and not completing the journey to her intended destination. He knew that she was very angry and in order not to adversely affect his Grab ratings, he sent the messages to apologise to the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     While he was on his way to his fiancée’s house, the Accused received a call from an unknown caller. He rejected the call twice as he was driving. When the caller called the third time, the Accused thought it was urgent and answered the call. The call was from Adam.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Accused gave evidence that the caller (referring to Adam) was very rude and spoke in a mixture of Hokkien, English and Mandarin. As Adam used threatening language and vulgarities on him, the Accused hung up the call. Thereafter, he started to receive text messages on his phone from Adam.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Accused’s main explanation surrounding the text messages was that he was apologising for not completing the journey and not sending the Victim to her original destination. His “mistake” was in dropping his passenger off halfway of the journey, and he really felt apologetic about this. The Accused also thought that it was a trivial matter, and he did not wish to let his parents and fiancée down or feel disappointed that he did not fulfil his responsibility of sending his passenger to the intended destination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Finally, the Accused maintained that he never exposed his penis to the Victim but Adam wanted him to admit to something that he had not done. He was also worried about the safety of his loved ones if he were to agree for them to meet up with Adam and the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On 25 January 2020 at about 7.22pm, the Accused decided to make a police report (exhibit D6) for record purposes to safeguard himself and for Grab. In the police report, the Accused stated that the Victim’s claims that he was touching and stroking his penis in front of her was not true as he has a history of hives with medical record, and he would scratch his whole body from time to time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     He explained that he would itch at his arms and thighs when he has a relapse of the hives, and he would sub-consciously scratch himself. He further explained that based on the clothing that he wore on that day, it would be very difficult for him to unzip his trousers, pull down his underwear to expose his penis and stroke his penis whilst driving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The Accused further explained that given the heavy downpour and traffic conditions, and that he needed to use both his hands to operate a new car that he just collected, manipulate the left and right switches, and steer the steering wheel, and that he is right-handed, it would be impossible for him to do what the Victim said he did.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     During cross-examination by the learned DPP, the Accused agreed that while the Victim looked furious and he did not know what she was unhappy about, he only thought of sending an apology to her. It never occurred to him to ask her what she was upset about. He maintained that he had no idea what mistake was it that he had realised, and assumed that the mistake was that he had dropped the Victim off midway or that his driving had caused her to feel uncomfortable. He only found out what the Victim was upset about after he answered Adam’s call while he was driving to his fiancée’s home.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     When asked what was that something that he said he was never going to do again, the Accused said that he did not know, and that they were just empty words to pacify the Victim. He disagreed with the learned DPP that it was for exposing his penis and masturbating in front of the Victim. He also maintained that he was apologising to Adam for dropping his girlfriend midway of the journey, notwithstanding that he knew this was not what Adam was angry about.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As for the Accused having hives, he agreed with the learned DPP that even if he felt itchy at his groin area, he would not scratch his private part area in front of his female passenger who was seated beside him in the front seat.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Loh Xue Qi (DW2)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Accused’s wife (then-fiancée) gave evidence that on 24 January 2018, when the Accused went to her house for dinner, he looked upset. After dinner, she brought him to the bedroom to find out what happened.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Accused confided in her that he had picked up a female passenger who had accused him of taking out his penis and after that, he kept receiving threatening calls from a man. The person also managed to locate her father, her brother and her sister-in-law on social media and tried to contact her.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Adam later messaged her and taught her to trick the Accused into admitting to her that he had exposed his penis and masturbated in front of his passenger. She felt that it could be a misunderstanding as the Accused could be scratching himself around his groin area due to his hives and the passenger mistook his actions to be touching his penis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Xue Qi further testified that it was impossible that the Accused would have committed such an offence. She knew his personality and the Accused would usually apologise for something even before knowing what he did wrong. Furthermore, the Accused was apologising for dropping the passenger halfway, and not for exposing his penis to his passenger.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Tham Jia Jia Cherie (DW4)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The defence also called Xue Qi’s sister-in-law to give evidence that on 24 January 2018, Adam has messaged her to ask her husband (Xue Qi’s brother) to check his Facebook message. Adam also told her that the Accused had sexually assaulted his girlfriend and he have proof and that his girlfriend wanted to make a police report.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Upon receiving the message, she replied to Adam that she would get Xue Qi to talk to his girlfriend. She then informed Xue Qi and showed her Adam’s number. She later realised that Adam managed to seek out the other members of the family. When she showed Xue Qi the messages, Xue Qi told her to ignore Adam. After that, she returned to her own room.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Dr Boon Jia Bin (DW3)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The defence called Dr Boon Jia Bin, a General Practitioner under the medical clinic of Sunbeam Medical Clinic to give evidence that the Accused went to the clinic on 27 December 2017 and complained of urticarial rash / hives over his entire body nightly for the past two months. He was treated with some antihistamines, a short course of oral steroid, given reassurance and advised to maintain good skin hygiene and skin care. He was asked to return for review if his symptoms did not improve.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Based on the clinical notes, it was observed that there was an urticarial rash all over his upper limbs, lower limbs all over his back and some over his neck region. However, it was not written in the clinical notes whether the patient mentioned any particular part of his body that was itchy, such as his inner thighs or groin.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The medication prescribed to the Accused, namely the antihistamine and oral steroid would last him 20 days, and he did not return to the clinic for a duplicate prescription. The Accused next visited the clinic on 24 February 2018 and 18 December 2018 for upper respiratory tract infection. On both occasions, there was no mention of urticarial rash during the consultations.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     At the end of the trial, the main issue to be determined by the court was a question of fact, i.e. whether the Victim’s evidence was “so unusually convincing” such that her testimony alone was sufficient for the prosecution to discharge its burden of proof.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In <em>Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24365-SSP.xml')">[2020] 1 SLR 486</a>, the Court of Appeal explained that the “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case [is] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”: citing <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/56310-M.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR 601</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Likewise in <em>Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19595-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 636</a>, the Court of Appeal explained that “a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’” (citing <em>Mohammed Liton</em> at [39]). The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’ demeanour, as well as the internal and external consistencies of the witness’ evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessment of the Victim’s Evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Having had the benefit of observing the Victim gave her evidence, I found her to be a credible witness, and that her evidence contained “a ring of truth”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     During her testimony, the Victim gave evidence that was clear, coherent, and she could recall what happened in the car with the Accused. She was candid with her answers and did not embellish her evidence in any way so as to cast the Accused in a bad light. Her evidence describing her emotions were candid and entirely believable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In my view, the Victim’s actions and behaviour after alighting from the Accused’s car were entirely consistent with her account of her having experienced something unpleasant or alarming during the ride in the Accused’s car.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     As submitted by the prosecution, the Victim had told Adam about the incident very shortly after it happened, and thereafter, Adam also called the Accused to confront him for exposing his penis to the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     When the Victim called Adam after alighting from the Accused’s car and recounted what happened, Adam described her as sounding very shocked and hyper, like her adrenaline was running. This was consistent with the Victim having just experienced something alarming.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I found the Victim’s evidence to be materially consistent with what she recounted to her boyfriend. Adam’s testimony in court and recollection of what the Victim had told him were largely consistent with the Victim’s evidence in the material aspects, in particular, what she saw the Accused did in the car, how she tried to handle the situation by striking up a conversation with the Accused, and eventually confronting the Accused about the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Furthermore, the Victim’s evidence in court was also materially consistent with the police report that she filed a day after the incident. In the said report (exhibit P4), she recounted the details from the start of her ride and what she noticed the driver to be doing, to the time she felt something was amiss and saw that the Accused was using his hand to touch his exposed penis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     She also related in the police report that fearing for her safety, she started a conversation with the Accused, who then covered his penis using his hand. She finally took up the courage to confront the Accused about his actions. While the Accused initially “acted blur”, he eventually apologised and admitted that it was the first time that he committed such an act in front of his passenger.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The defence submitted that there were clear omissions and inconsistencies between the Victim’s evidence in court and the police report lodged by her. For example, her testimony that the Accused would “now and then” cover his penis with his hand during their conversation, whereas in the police report, the Victim stated that the Accused covered his penis using his hand upon hearing her say that they could have mutual friend as they both stayed at the Bukit Panjang area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The defence further highlighted that the Victim omitted to mention in her police report that she had informed the Accused that her mother also worked at Philips Singapore, that she saw a photograph of the Accused’s fiancée on his handphone which triggered her to confront the Accused, and that the Accused allegedly offered to send her home before she asked to be dropped off at the Royal Plaza on Scotts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    With due respect to the learned Counsel, I did not consider these omissions to be significant. One could not expect the same level of details of conversations to be recorded in the First Information Report as compared with the testimony elicited from a witness through the rigours of the examination of witness in court. More pertinently, I observed that the Victim did not embellish her account of the incident in the police report or her testimony in court. In this respect, I could not agree with the defence’s submission that the omissions on some of the details in the police report had rendered her evidence unreliable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In summary, having carefully considered the Victim’s evidence and having observed the Victim gave her evidence in court, I found that she was an unusually convincing witness, and I accepted her version of what had happened in the car. Her testimony in court was materially consistent with what she recounted to her boyfriend, and also in the police report that she filed the next day after the incident. Her reactions during and after the incident were also consistent with her being alarmed after having seen the Accused’s penis and masturbated in the car.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    For completeness, I should state that I have considered the learned Counsel’s submission that the Victim could have been mistaken about what she had seen, such as the Accused scratching his crotch. This led to her imagination running wild and the allegation then took a life of its own.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    However, I was satisfied that the Victim was not mistaken that the Accused was scratching his crotch as this was not supported by the evidence adduced before the court. While it was not disputed that the Accused had consulted Dr Boon on 27 December 2017 and complained of urticarial rash / hives on his upper limbs, lower limbs all over his back and some over his neck region, the evidence also revealed that he was duly treated with medication, and his condition had improved by January 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The Accused further confirmed in his evidence during cross-examination that he did not scratch his groin or penis at any point during the journey, and that at most, he only scratched his middle inner thigh. As such, the Victim could not have been mistaken about what she saw given that she sat at the front passenger seat and would have a full view of the Accused beside her. To that extent, I also agreed with the prosecution that it would be reasonable to infer that the Accused had intended for the Victim to see his exposed penis and actions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In my view, there was really no reason for the Victim to fabricate the allegations against the Accused since she did not know the Accused before the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessment of the Accused’s Evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The accused’s defence was one of denial. He denied having exposed his penis to the Victim and that he did not know what had happened in the car that led to his passenger deciding to discontinue the journey mid-way.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Having carefully considered the Accused’s testimony, I did not find the Accused to be a credible witness and I found his account of the incident to be unbelievable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    First, I did not find the Accused’s explanations for his admission and apology to the Victim during the journey and immediately after the ride to be believable. In my view, there was no reason for the Accused to apologise to the Victim during the car ride given that the Victim had not asked to be dropped off half-way, and there was no question of him not sending his passenger to the intended destination. It was only after she confronted the Accused that she felt uncomfortable to continue the journey and decided not to proceed to her intended destination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Furthermore, it was clear that the conversation between the Victim and the Accused was not about the Accused having previously dropped off a passenger halfway or mid-way of the journey, and not completing the journey but something more serious. In my view, there was no plausible explanation for the Victim to threaten to report the Accused to the police for not completing the journey, especially when it was the Victim who had wanted to discontinue the ride and declined the Accused’s offer to send her to her intended destination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Secondly, I found that the two apology text messages that the Accused sent to the Victim to be the most fatal and damaging to his defence. I did not accept his explanations for sending her the two apology text messages, or the contents therein, where he admitted that he had realised his mistake, and apologised to the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    More significantly, the Accused added in his message that he would “never do it again”. It was inconceivable and unbelievable that the Accused would be apologizing and avowing that he would never do something again, if he claimed not to know what happened in the first place. This is so if the court were to accept that the Accused was a person prone to apologise profusely for something that he did not do, either because he was working in the sales line or that he was worried about receiving a poor rating from his passenger.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In this respect, I found myself to be in agreement with the prosecution that the Accused’s admission and apologies merely served to confirm his guilt towards the Victim after she saw his exposed penis and what he did. Suffice to note, the apologies continued during the phone calls and text messages between the Accused and Adam. I was of the view that the Accused’s apologies could not have been for something as innocuous as dropping a passenger mid-way of the journey, but something more serious and sinister that could warrant the lodging of a police report by the passenger.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Thirdly, one would have reasonably expected the Accused to clarify any misunderstanding with his passenger what was it about the ride or journey that she was unhappy about, instead of admitting to a false allegation such as exposing his penis to his passenger.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Furthermore, I found it rather odd that the Accused would be begging Adam for forgiveness so as not to disappoint his parents and loved ones because of his “one-time mistake” of not sending his passenger to the destination, when it was abundantly clear that this was not the purpose of Adam’s call. As submitted by the learned DPP, this was more consistent with the guilt of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The defence also submitted that given the clothes that the Accused was wearing at the material time, that he was driving a new vehicle that he had just collected, and that he needed both his hands to drive over a distance in the wet weather conditions, it would be practically impossible for the Accused to have committed the alleged act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    However, I was not persuaded by the submission as it was not the case of the prosecution that the Accused had unfastened and/or unzipped his trousers while he was driving. As submitted by the prosecution, the Accused could have exposed his penis during the early part of the drive when the Victim thought that he was fidgeting with his seatbelt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Furthermore, it was also not the prosecution’s case that the Accused was touching his penis constantly throughout the drive. The Victim’s evidence was that she did not look directly at the Accused’s penis again after she had confirmed that he was masturbating. The Victim was not able to recall where the Accused’s hands were for the rest of the journey, neither was it her evidence that the Accused’s right hand was on his lap for the entire duration of the drive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Finally, I was not able to agree with the learned Defence Counsel’s submission that the Victim could have fabricated the allegations against the Accused as a precursor to demand money from him and his family, or that she was inspired by the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. There was simply no basis or any evidence to support this contention.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Verdict</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In the final analysis, I found the Victim to be an unusually convincing witness and I found her to be a truthful witness and I accepted her testimony. Conversely, I did not accept the Accused’s explanations and his defence, and I disbelieved the Accused’s denial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Accordingly, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and I found the Accused guilty of the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prescribed Penalty</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 509 of the Penal Code is an imprisonment term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The Accused had no antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The prosecution submitted that the primary sentencing consideration in the present case was one of general deterrence. The learned DPP highlighted that the Accused committed the offence whilst in his capacity as a Grab driver performing the functions of a public transport worker. In the interests of public safety, and to deter would-be drivers to take advantage of their passengers, a deterrence sentence was called for. The prosecution submitted a sentence of <b>at least 6 week’s imprisonment</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The prosecution also highlighted several aggravating factors present in this case. Specifically, the offence took place in the confined space of the taxi, which would have heightened the Victim’s state of fear. Being at the front passenger seat and within the easy reach of the Accused, she would not have been able to exit the car while it was moving.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The Accused’s actions were brazen, persistent and deliberate. It was not a fleeting or momentary act. The Victim saw the Accused stroking his penis twice, and that was after she initially thought he was fiddling with his seatbelt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Finally, the Accused displayed a lack of remorse and he lodged a police report the day after the incident to disclaim his liability. In his police report, he lied that he had not exposed or stroked his penis in front of the Victim. He had also elected to claim trial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The prosecution also cited precedent cases for the offence of indecent exposure and public masturbation, which showed a sentencing range for such offences to be between <b>two (2) to six (6) weeks’ imprisonment</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In this respect, the learned DPP submitted that the facts of the present case were most similar to the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Cheng Tim Ann</em> (MCN-900725-2015), where the public transport worker exposed his penis to a female passenger (21 years old), while driving his taxi. He used his left hand to continuously stroke his penis. While doing so, he repeatedly asked the victim if she saw anything, despite her reply that she did not see anything as she was afraid, even though she had noticed his exposed penis. The taxi driver, who was traced for a section 294 Penal Code offence, was sentenced to six (6) weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In his mitigation plea, the learned Defence Counsel highlighted the mitigating factors that the Accused has no prior antecedents, at the time of the commission offence, he was only 23 years old, and he was of good character.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    His learned Counsel urged the court to consider that the time the parties spent in the vehicle together was between 15 to 20 minutes. There was no physical contact and the Accused did not utter any threats against the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    His learned Counsel further submitted that the Accused was merely giving the Victim a ride back home through Grab Hitch, and that he was not performing the function of a public transport worker as he was not operating the vehicle as a private car hire driver at the material time of the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    It was also highlighted that the offence was not premeditated and the Victim in this case was not a young child or teenager but an adult victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    His learned Counsel also informed the court that the Accused has suffered adversely from the extensive media coverage about the incident, and has lost his job and had trouble finding employment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The defence submitted that the sentencing considerations should be one of rehabilitation and general deterrence, and submitted that a fine of not more than $2,000 would be an appropriate punishment, citing cases where fines had been imposed for a s 509 Penal Code offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In particular, the defence relied on the case of <em>GCO v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22824-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 31</a> which case involved the Appellant, who had entered a female toilet when he heard someone showering, and peeped over the cubicle partition to see the victim who was showering and fully naked. The victim noticed the Appellant and immediately sought help. The Appellant remained in the shower cubicle and eventually surrendered to the security.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    On appeal, the High Court substituted a sentence of one month’s imprisonment with a fine of $5,000. The High Court considered that there was no aggravating factor in the use of technology and held that the key consideration was whether the offence was premeditated. On the facts of that case, there was nothing to suggest that the Appellant had given a great deal of foresight or planning prior to committing the offence: <em>GCO</em> at [101].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The defence submitted that as the Accused’s actions were not premeditated and he has no antecedents, and the Victim was not a young child but an adult, a sentence of a fine not exceeding $2,000 would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for Sentence Imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    In deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose, I was of the view that the predominant sentencing consideration in this case must be one of deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    In <em>Public Prosecutor v Heng Swee Weng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0954.xml')">[2010] 1 SLR 954</a>, V K Rajah JA (as he then was), held that public transport providers, such as taxi drivers, have a “special position” vis-à-vis their passengers. All passengers travelling in taxis are entitled to expect at all times, that they can do so in complete safety without being taken advantage of by taxi drivers, regardless of whether they are fare passengers or not. Accordingly, a strong message has to be sent out to those working in the public transport service sector that behaviour taking advantage of more helpless commuters will and shall not be tolerated by the courts: at [20] and [28].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    His Honour also referred to the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Neo Boon Seng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0216.xml')">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 216</a>, where Chan Sek Keong CJ imposed a custodial sentence for a property offence against a taxi driver who had misappropriated items left behind by a passenger. CJ Chan was of the view [at 16] that “public policy would therefore call for deterrent sentences to discourage dishonesty in taxi drivers. […] the courts should send a message that any dishonest conduct will not be condoned and the benchmark punishment will be a custodial sentence, save in exceptional circumstances.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    While I accept that the Accused was not working as a full-time public transport provider at the material time of the incident but was moon-lighting as a Grab Car and Grab Hitch driver, I agreed with the prosecution that in the interest of public safety of the passengers, the court must send a clear message that such conduct will not be condoned.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The landscape of public transport in Singapore has evolved over the years with the participation of other providers of transport to the public. Private hire car services, such as Grab, have become more prevalent and are gaining acceptance as an alternative to licensed ride-hailing taxi operators. These private hire car drivers can be considered as performing a form of “public service” to our commuters, offering the public with a wider choice of transportation options, with different and more competitive fare structures.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Hence, as rightly submitted by the prosecution, there was no reason why these private hire cars should not be held to an equivalent standard. When a passenger booked a ride, whether from a private hire car or taxi, there would still be a legitimate expectation that the driver would be responsible for safely driving the passenger to the intended destination, and without the passenger’s modesty being outraged or insulted by the driver.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    While I recognised that there were different schemes and booking platforms for private hire cars, such as Grab Car, Grab Share and Grab Hitch which the Accused could operate, with due respect to his learned Counsel, I was not persuaded by the submission that there ought to be a distinction between the Accused committing the offence whilst he was operating under the Grab Hitch or Grab Car mobile app platform. In my view, it would be too artificial a distinction to draw as a matter of sentencing policy.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The fact of the matter was that the Accused saw it fit to commit the offence against his female passenger, whom he had just picked up, barely a few minutes into the journey. The offence was committed in the confined space of a car, and the Victim who was seated beside him at the front seat, was the lone passenger. As the evidence revealed, she was evidently shocked and scared during the journey. She was afraid that the accused would turn aggressive towards her. Unlike other cases of “flashing” in a public place, the Victim could not flee or extricate herself from the situation after having started the journey, and would have been in a heightened state of alarm and fear, not knowing what else the Accused was capable of doing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    However, I also note that the evidence showed that when the Victim initiated conversation with the Accused, he periodically covered his penis with his hands and did not show any aggression, anger, or signs that would cause the Victim to be worried. In fact, she found sufficient courage to confront the Accused, who then became very apologetic and apologised to the Victim and said that he had realised his mistake and would never do it again.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    While the prosecution submitted that the Accused had displayed an “utter lack of remorse”, the evidence adduced at trial also showed that the Accused had repeatedly apologised to the Victim and later, to her boyfriend and pleaded for a chance and their forgiveness in the hope to settle the matter. Unfortunately, it was when the Accused did not agree to admit to his parents and fiancée that the matter came to be reported to the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    While I have considered that this was the Accused’s first offence, and that he was relatively young in age when he committed the offence, I was not able to agree with the learned Defence Counsel’s submission for a fine to be imposed. In my view, a custodial sentence was warranted in the present case to meet the objective of a general deterrence, and this clearly outweighed the rehabilitation principle, considering that the Accused had not shown any remorse for his offence notwithstanding his apologies to the Victim and boyfriend.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In my view, the cases cited by the defence in support of the submission of a fine could be distinguished. In the case of <em>GCO v Public Prosecutor</em>, which involved a “peeping Tom”, the offence was quite different in character and nature, and there were no aggravating factors, such as the use of technology to film the unsuspecting victim who was showering in the toilet cubicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    As for the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Ali Hossain Late Abdul Hakim</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/60123-M.xml')">[2008] SGDC 380</a>, likewise there were no aggravating factors, neither did the principle of general deterrence feature strongly in that case. The Appellant was delivering materials to the victim’s home that was undergoing renovation when he unzipped his jeans and exposed his penis to the victim. The victim was frightened and left the home immediately and took the lift downstairs, and the Appellant followed her in the lift.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    In that case, the offensive act was for a very short duration as the victim ran out immediately. He did not further harm the victim and repeatedly apologised to the victim, who was an adult and not a vulnerable victim. In the circumstances, the court was of the view that a custodial sentence was not warranted and imposed a fine of $2,000 as he was not a “hardened criminal”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    As for Mr Wee’s submission that the Accused was of good character, that he has suffered through the extensive media coverage about the incident and has lost his job, and that he would have trouble finding employment, it is trite law that these are hardly relevant mitigating factors and should be given limited or no weight by the sentencing court, having regard to the key sentencing objectives. Any adverse consequences or any hardship occasioned to the Accused arising from the conviction was brought upon by his own actions. [see <em>Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20576-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 185</a>.]</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    In the final analysis, I was of the view that the principle of deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration in this case, and it clearly outweighed the rehabilitative principle submitted by the defence. I was of the view that a short custodial sentence was warranted to deter like-minded persons from committing such offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In this regard, having considered the aggravating factors highlighted by the prosecution, and giving some due consideration to the mitigating factors submitted by the defence, I calibrated the sentence submitted by the prosecution downwards to four (4) weeks’ imprisonment. I was of the view that the sentence imposed was in line with the table of precedent cases tendered by the prosecution, and that the sentence would adequately meet the sentencing objectives and serve the ends of justice.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    All considered, the Accused was sentenced to <b>four (4) weeks’ imprisonment</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The Accused being dissatisfied with the decision had lodged an appeal against both his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending appeal.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap8 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
