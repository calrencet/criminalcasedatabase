id="p1_1"></a>1       This was the first case prosecuted under s 420A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge of obtaining sexual services dishonestly from the Victim, by deceiving her into believing that he would pay $1,500.00 for 2 hours of sexual services. No payment was made by the Accused for these sexual services afforded to him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Having framed a sentencing matrix, the Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of at least 3 years. For reasons given below at [59(a)-(e)], I declined to propose a sentencing matrix for s 420A of the Penal Code. Instead, in this judgment, I will (a) set out the offence-specific and offender-specific factors for offences under s 420A of the Penal Code, and (b) apply these sentencing considerations to the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       All things considered, I sentenced the Accused to 32 months’ imprisonment. I set out my reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 420A(1) punishable under s 420A(2) of the Penal Code. The charge was as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, ABDUL RAHMAN BIN A KARIM, MALE/ 37 YEARS OLD, SINGAPORE CITIZEN, are charged that you, on 11 August 2020, in Singapore, did obtain services for yourself dishonestly from [the Victim], <em>to wit</em>, by deceiving her into believing that you were a sexual services agent and will deliver $1,500.00 to her in exchange for her providing you with 2 hours of sexual services, and her sexual services were made available to you on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and you obtained her sexual services without any payment having been made for or in respect of them, and when you obtained her sexual services, you knew that her sexual services were being made available to you on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them, and you intended that payment will not be made, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced [the Victim] to deliver her sexual services to you, which she would not have done so had she not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 420A(1) and punishable under Section 420A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statement of facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Accused is Abdul Rahman Bin A Karim, a 37-year-old male Singaporean. At the time of the offence, the Accused was employed as a warehouse assistant, and resided at Bedok (the “Accused’s flat”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Victim is a 25-year-old female Singaporean. At the time of the offence, the Victim was a student.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>First information report</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 12 August 2020, at about 11.09am, the Victim lodged an e-Police report with Jurong Division HQ to inform that she had been cheated after she did not receive payment for sexual services she provided on the evening of 11 August 2020. The incident location provided was the Accused’s flat.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4"> <u>Facts pertaining to the charge</u> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Investigations revealed that sometime on 11 August 2020, the Victim received a direct message on Instagram (“IG”) from a user bearing the IG handle “@tempt_soul”. The direct message stated: “<em>Hi, we are an escort agency hiring new females. Discreet and safe. Lots of Cash $$$. Interested please PM</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Investigations revealed that prior to this, the Victim had never once provided any sexual or social escort services to anyone. The Victim had also never advertised herself to be interested in providing any sexual or social escort services. However, as the Victim was interested in earning fast cash to pay for the expenses for her school’s final-year project, she duly replied to indicate her interest. Through the IG conversation, the Victim understood the job description to be for the provision of sexual services, as she was instructed by “@tempt_soul” to bring her own condoms, and to provide her name, age, race, address, as well as height and weight. “@tempt_soul” stated that the Victim’s job was to provide sexual services to a client for the duration of 2 hours for a fee of $1,500.00. Subsequently, “@tempt_soul” requested to move their conversation to the chat application, “Telegram”. “Telegram” is a messaging application platform which allows users to permanently delete chat message history for both the sender and the recipient of the message. The Victim agreed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Subsequently, the Victim corresponded over “Telegram” with a user bearing the “Telegram” handle “D Angelz”. The Victim understood that the user “D Angelz” was the same person who was using the IG handle “@tempt_soul”. “D Angelz” then provided the Victim with instructions to proceed to the Accused’s flat via a Grab private hire transport at 7.00pm on 11 August 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Investigations revealed that the Accused had used both the IG handle “@tempt_soul” and the “Telegram” account with the username “D Angelz” to correspond with the Victim. The Victim agreed to make 2 hours of her sexual services available to the Accused on the basis that payment of $1,500.00 will be made for or in respect of them. The Victim did not ask for upfront payment for her sexual services as “D Angelz” had assured her that the client would pay her once she had provided the sexual services. The Victim then took a Grab private hire transport from her residence in the west of Singapore to the Accused’s flat as instructed. During her commute, the Victim realised that her earlier “Telegram” chat history with “D Angelz” had been deleted. However, the Victim did not suspect that anything was amiss then.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Victim arrived at the Accused’s flat at 7.16pm. The Accused answered the door and brought the Victim into his room. Thereat, the Victim engaged in one round of penile-vaginal intercourse with the Accused. The Accused wanted a second round and offered to pay the victim an additional $500.00 in order to penetrate her anus with his penis. On the basis that she would be paid an additional $500.00, the Victim agreed to try but told the Accused to “go slow” when inserting his penis into her anus. The Victim then got into position by turning around to face her buttocks to the Accused, with her knees and elbows on the bed. However, the Accused proceeded to forcefully penetrate the Victim’s anus from behind with his penis. This caused the Victim immense pain and she screamed, telling the Accused repeatedly to stop. However, the Accused persisted in penetrating the Victim’s anus with his penis by grabbing her waist with his hands such that the Victim could not dislodge the Accused’s penis from her anus. After struggling (with the Accused’s penis continually penetrating her anus) for about 30 seconds, the Victim finally managed to push the Accused off. The Victim then went to the toilet of the Accused’s flat to wash her anal cavity, experiencing a sharp pain as she did so, and she discovered that she was bleeding from her anal cavity. The Victim cried from the pain but composed herself before stepping back out to the bedroom to complete the sexual services as agreed, as the Accused wanted the Victim to “<em>finish the session</em>”. The Accused then engaged in another round of penile-vaginal intercourse with the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     When the Accused obtained the Victim’s sexual services, he knew that her sexual services were being made available to him on the basis that payment will be made for or in respect of them. However, the Accused intended that payment for the Victim’s sexual services will not be made.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After providing 2 hours’ worth of sexual services to the Accused, the Victim asked the Accused for payment of $1,500.00. The Victim did not ask for $2,000.00 as she acknowledged that she did not manage to successfully complete the anal-penile sexual intercourse with the Accused. However, the Accused replied that the social escort agent will contact her and transfer her the money within an hour. When questioned why he could not just pay the Victim directly, the Accused answered that he already made payment to the social escort agent. The Victim then left the Accused’s flat to return home. The Victim attempted to contact “D Angelz” on “Telegram” to ask for payment and she was instructed to provide her bank account number and to wait for an hour for payment. The Victim complied with the instructions but realised that her earlier “Telegram” chat history with “D Angelz” had been deleted. After still not receiving the payment after an hour, she texted “D Angelz” on “Telegram” again. Her messages were ignored. The Victim then tried to contact “@tempt_soul” on IG, but she was blocked by the user.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Desperate, and left with no other options, the Victim took another Grab private hire transport from her residence to the Accused’s flat and requested the Accused to contact the social escort agent for payment.

Taxonomy should not take centre-stage in sentencing for its own sake. Where particular facts are relied upon to evidence either aggravating or mitigating considerations, regard must be had to the actual ambit of the facts and their relevance, purpose, and function in the sentencing process.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For example, labelling a particular fact as showing ‘old age’, ‘vulnerability’ or ‘misuse of a financial instrument’ without going deeper would rarely be useful, and often, might actually be unhelpful: <em>Rachel Ann Fernandez v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25268-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 248</a> at [20].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Two broad observations can be made in relation to the Analytical Framework:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     The synergistic interplay between harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     The eclectic ensemble of cases adopting the Analytical Framework is testament to its versatility.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     First, the synergistic interplay of harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing. While facts are the cornerstone, harm and culpability are the pillars on which we place the cross-beams of aggravating and mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The typical framework consists of a 2-step sentencing bands framework as found in <em>Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20745-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 449</a> (“<em>Terence Ng”)</em> at [73(a), (c) and (d)] (see also the 5-step sentencing bands framework in <em>Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22002-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 609</a> (“<em>Logachev</em>”) at [71]-[84], which is applied in the present case).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At the first step, the court should have regard to the <em>offence-specific</em> factors in deciding which band the offence in question falls under. Offence-specific factors comprise factors going towards: (a) the harm caused by the offence; and (b) the offender’s culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     These categories may not always be watertight. For instance, the degree of planning and premeditation and the level of sophistication, were categorised as offence-specific factors going towards the offender’s <em>culpability</em> in <em>Logachev</em>. Yet, the High Court observed that they may also relate to the <em>harm</em> caused by the offence in so far as they affect the likelihood of harm: <em>Logachev</em> at [38] (see also <em>Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23956-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 526</a> at [79], and <em>Public Prosecutor v ASR</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23195-SSP.xml')">[2019] 1 SLR 941</a> at [131]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may usually be imposed for an offence with those features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an indicative starting point.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender to calibrate the sentence. These <em>offender-specific</em> factors comprise other aggravating and mitigating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence: <em>Logachev</em> at [34], and <em>Terence Ng</em> at [39(b)].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     One model of the 2-step sentencing bands framework finds expression in drug trafficking and importation cases where the quantity of the drugs indicates the potential harm to society. In this regard, the indicative starting sentence – based on the quantity of the drugs (<em>viz.</em> potential harm) – may be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  Essentially, <em>harm</em> is the fulcrum for such cases.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Examples of these cases include <em>Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18022-SSP.xml')">[2015] 5 SLR 122</a> at [43]-[48] (drug trafficking) and <em>Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20605-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 115</a> at [29]-[30] (drug importation).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In similar vein, for voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code, the seriousness of the injury caused (<em>viz.</em> harm) is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and guides the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing. The indicative starting sentence may then be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and other aggravating and mitigating factors: <em>Public Prosecutor v BDB</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> at [55].  The same approach applies for s 323 of the Penal Code: <em>Low Song Chye</em> at [76]-[78].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Another model of the 2-step sentencing bands framework can be found in fatal accident cases under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code. For such cases, as the harm is the death of the victim, the harm is generally uniform. Accordingly, what sets such cases apart is, in the vast majority of cases, determined primarily by the accused’s culpability.  After considering the accused’s culpability, a sentencing court takes into account other aggravating and mitigating factors: <em>Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21207-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 681</a> at [54].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Finally, in <em>Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21702-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1080</a> at [52], [57] and [60], the 3-Judge Panel noted that the:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors are necessarily factored into the analysis within the harm and culpability considerations themselves.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     An example of this approach may be found in <em>Public Prosecutor v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram &amp; Ors</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21209-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 707</a> at [50]-[56], where the 3-Judge Panel held that exceptional performance during National Service was not a mitigating factor, as it reduces neither the defaulter’s <em>culpability</em> nor the <em>harm</em> he had caused by his offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     For completeness, in lieu of using the 2-step sentencing bands framework as a starting point for sentencing, the High Court in <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Chai Heng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23823-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 272</a> stated that the starting inquiry in sentencing offenders with a mental disorder ought to be whether the deterrent, retributive and protective principles of sentencing prevail over the principle of rehabilitation. </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The second observation is that the eclectic ensemble of cases adopting the Analytical Framework is testament to its versatility.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     These cases include participating in a corrupt transaction with an agent under s 6 read with s 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (<em>Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25448-SSP.xml')">[2020] 5 SLR 807</a>), stalking under s 7 of the Protection from Harassment Act (<em>Lee Shing Chan and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25041-SSP.xml')">[2020] 4 SLR 1174</a>), ss 11(1) and 8 of the Remote Gambling Act (<em>Koo Kah Yee v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25327-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 261</a> and <em>Lau Jian Bang v Public Prosecutor</em> [2019] 3 SLR 1161), s 331(3A) read with s 240(1) of the Securities and Futures Act (<em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Seo Whatt Albert and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23964-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 654</a> at [50]-[56]), offences under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (<em>Nurun Novi Saydur Rahman v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22956-SSP.xml')">[2019] 3 SLR 413</a> and <em>GS Engineering</em>), digital-penetration under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code (<em>Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21095-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 1015</a>), and ss 140, 146, and 148 of the Women’s Charter (<em>Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17081-SSP.xml')">[2014] 4 SLR 892</a>).

This was evidenced by the fact that the Sentencing Information and Research Repository had no relevant cases.

Indeed, these cases suggest that a paucity of reliable reference points or reasoned decisions might make it necessary to propose a sentencing matrix for principled decision-making. In doing so, rather than draw on a small number of sentencing precedents, the courts will approach the matter from first principles.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     However, in the present case, I declined to propose a sentencing matrix for s 420A of the Penal Code for the following interlacing reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     Given that s 420A of the Penal Code is a <em>new</em> offence, a sentencing matrix should not be formulated as the lack of precedents makes it difficult to discern any trend in sentencing: <em>Tan Gek Young v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21219-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 820</a> at [58], <em>Public Prosecutor v BPK</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22600-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 755</a> at [55(b)], and <em>Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24571-SSP.xml')">[2020] 3 SLR 1097</a> at [11]. I did not have the benefit of reasoned decisions that detail and elaborate on the various factual scenarios and relevant sentencing considerations that might arise across the spectrum of cases (<em>Ye Lin Myint</em> at [42]). In fact, as this is the <em>first</em> case prosecuted under s 420A, there are <em>no</em> relevant precedents. In contrast, there were already several sentencing precedents before <em>Logachev</em> and <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> were decided by the Supreme Court. </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     Allied to this, offences under s 420A may be committed in a number of factually diverse situations involving varying degrees of harm and culpability (see generally, <em>Koh Yong Chiah v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20046-SSP.xml')">[2017] 3 SLR 447</a> at [46]-[49], <em>Liew Zheng Yang v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21251-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 1160</a> at [9]-[16], <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Thian Earn</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18926-SSP.xml')">[2016] 3 SLR 269</a> at [35]-[36], <em>BPK</em> at [55(a)], <em>Ye Lin Myint</em> at [44], and <em>Ng Soon Kim</em> at [11]) (see also Tan Yock Lin and S. Chandra Mohan, <em>Criminal Procedure</em> (LexisNexis: 2019; Binder 3, Chapter XVII: Sentencing) at [804] on p 253).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     While the sentence in <em>Gene Chong</em> was affirmed on appeal by the High Court, the High Court did not comment on the sentencing matrix for s 420 of the Penal Code. </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_d"></a>(d)     It is recognised that ss 420A and 420 are both found in the Penal Code under <em>Chapter XVII</em>. Section 420A had been inserted, immediately after s 420 of the Penal Code, by the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 (Act 15 of 2019). Sections 420A and 420 also have the same maximum sentence (i.e. up to 10 years’ imprisonment). Nevertheless, there are differences between offences under s 420 vis-à-vis s 420A of the Penal Code – this explains why there is an option of imposing <em>only a fine</em> for s 420A but not under s 420, which has <em>mandatory</em> imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_e"></a>(e)     For completeness, I considered proposing a sentencing matrix for s 420A that was confined to sexual services but I decided against doing so (see generally, <em>Tang Ling Lee v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22137-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 813</a> at [24], and <em>Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22972-SSP.xml')">[2019] 3 SLR 606</a> at [47]). With the accretion of cases, future courts would be better placed to formulate a sentencing matrix for s 420A of the Penal Code if they consider it appropriate to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Against the above backdrop, in the remainder of this judgment, I will first set out the relevant sentencing considerations for offences under s 420A of the Penal Code, and second, apply these sentencing considerations to the present case (see generally, <em>Liew Zheng Yang</em> at [16]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In that light, I begin with the relevant sentencing considerations for an offence under s 420A of the Penal Code. These are broadly divided into offence-specific factors and offender-specific factors (<em>Terence Ng</em> at [39]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offence-specific factors </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In terms of offence-specific factors, the court should generally consider (a) the degree of harm caused by the offence; and (b) the degree of the offender’s culpability. A non-exhaustive list of offence-specific factors for an offence under s 420A of the Penal Code would include:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="49.86%"/> <col width="50.14%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Factors going towards harm</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Factors going towards culpability</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) The amount cheated</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Treatment of the victim</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) Degree of planning and premeditation</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Level of sophistication/ difficulty of detection</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) Duration of offending</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As the offence-specific factors do overlap to some degree, care must be taken to avoid doubly penalising the offender in the sentencing assessment: <em>Ye Lin Myint</em> at [58].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Harm</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64      <u>Amount Cheated</u>. The amount cheated must be taken into account as this represents at least a part of the harm caused to the victim. All other things being equal, a higher amount cheated should lead to a higher sentence: <em>Logachev</em> at [40].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The amount cheated should <em>not</em> be the sole consideration or touchstone for offences under s 420A of the Penal Code. I prefer to regard the amount cheated as one factor that goes towards the broader question of the harm caused by the offence (see also <em>Logachev</em> at [43]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     To my mind, there are four reasons for this:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     The “damage or harm” may not be capable of being clearly defined; damage or harm may sometimes be <em>intangible</em> when it assumes the form of inconvenience, embarrassment, or loss of reputation (Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition: Volume I, LexisNexis, 2013) at page 836). This point is brought to sharp focus when a “victim is deceived into providing a service for (an) accused person at no measurable cost to the victim” (Penal Code Review Committee Report (August 2018) at pages 4 and 48).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     Singling out the amount cheated has the potential to divert attention away from other relevant sentencing considerations that go towards the <em>harm</em> caused by the offence punishable under s 420A(2): <em>Logachev</em> at [44].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_c"></a>(c)     Singling out the amount cheated also has the potential to divert attention away from the relevant sentencing considerations that go towards the offender’s <em>culpability</em>: <em>Logachev</em> at [47]-[48].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_d"></a>(d)     Having the amount cheated as the sole factor in determining the sentence is monochromatic — it constrains the court’s ability to give effect to the four general principles of retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation during sentencing (see also <em>Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0617.xml')">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 617</a> at [60]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67      <u>Treatment of victim</u>. The offender’s treatment of the victim may also be a relevant consideration: <em>Poh Boon Kiat</em> at [76]. Ill-treating the victim would have an aggravating effect.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Culpability</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68      <u>Planning and Premeditation</u>. Offences that are committed as a result of planning and premeditation will be viewed as attracting greater culpability as compared to those committed opportunistically or on impulse: <em>Logachev</em> at [56] (see also the Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition: Volume I, LexisNexis, 2013) at page 836). This is because the presence of planning and premeditation generally evince a greater commitment towards law-breaking: <em>Terence Ng</em> at [44(c)], <em>Mehra Radhika v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16789-SSP.xml')">[2015] 1 SLR 96</a> at [41]-[42], and <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> at [61] (see also Andrew Ashworth, <em>Sentencing and Criminal Justice</em> (Cambridge University Press, 6th Ed, 2015) at page 171).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Planning and premeditation are two distinct concepts even though they overlap; a premeditated offence need not have very much planning but a planned offence is usually premeditated: <em>Mehra Radhika</em> at [42] (see also Kow Keng Siong, <em>Sentencing Principles in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at 16.006).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70      <u>Sophistication/ difficulty of detection</u>. The sophistication level in the planning, execution and concealment of the offence is also a relevant consideration: <em>Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0334.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 334</a> at [42]. The offence’s sophistication includes aspects such as the complexity and scale of the criminal operation in question: <em>Logachev</em> at [57]-[58].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     A sophisticated offence is replete with carefully orchestrated efforts and steps to avoid <em>detection</em> (Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition: Volume I, LexisNexis, 2013) at page 836). The difficulty of detecting the offences may thus be a relevant consideration: <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> at [25(d)].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In particular, when the deception is done on remote or online platforms, these tend to add a further cloak of anonymity and make detection even more challenging: <em>Public Prosecutor v Wang Ziyi Able</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 2 SLR(R) 1082.xml')">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 1082</a> at [31], and <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> at [60]. Using the Internet generally increases the culpability associated with an offence because it acts as a powerful multiplier allowing an offender to reach out to a larger pool of potential victims: <em>Poh Boon Kiat</em> at [94], <em>Public Prosecutor v Quek Chin Choon</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16978-SSP.xml')">[2015] 1 SLR 1169</a> at [38], and <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> at [62] (see also Kow Keng Siong, <em>Sentencing Principles in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at 16.040).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73      <u>Duration of Offending</u>. A longer duration of offending, all else remaining constant, typically demonstrates persistence in unlawful conduct and greater culpability compared to a one-off offence: <em>Neo Ah Luan</em> at [73], <em>Logachev</em> at [59], and <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> at [65].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offender-specific factors </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The offender-specific factors generally apply across different offences and cases, and include:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="50.14%"/> <col width="49.86%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Aggravating factors</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Mitigating factors</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) Offences taken into consideration </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Relevant antecedents</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) Evident lack of remorse</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) Guilty plea</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Voluntary restitution</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) Cooperation with the authorities</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     These aggravating and mitigating factors are well-established (see generally, <em>Logachev</em> at [64]-[70] and <em>Terence Ng</em> at [64]-[66]; see also, <em>Vasentha</em> at [72]-[73], and <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> at [66]-[67]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As the case law develops, the contours of the above offence-specific and offender-specific factors would need to be subsequently reconsidered and refined, and various sentencing considerations may be added.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application to the facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I now turn to applying the above offence-specific and offender-specific factors to the facts.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Offence-specific factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The first step is to identify (a) the level of harm caused by the offence (slight, moderate or severe); and (b) the offender’s culpability (low, medium or high) having regard to the relevant offence-specific factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79      <b><u>Harm</u></b> <b>.</b> There was moderate harm for the reasons set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The amount cheated was $1,500.00.

These sexual services included sexual intercourse, <em>viz.</em> the Accused used his penis to penetrate the Victim’s vagina and anus. Such sexually intimate acts intruded upon the Victim’s bodily integrity and privacy.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     During the sexual intercourse, the Accused ill-treated the Victim. The Accused had forcefully penetrated the Victim’s anus from behind with his penis, despite the fact that this caused the Victim immense pain and she had screamed, telling the Accused repeatedly to stop.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Accused persisted in penetrating the Victim’s anus with his penis by grabbing her waist with his hands such that she could not dislodge the Accused’s penis from her anus.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> After struggling (with the Accused’s penis continually penetrating her anus) for about 30 seconds, the Victim finally managed to push the Accused off.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The Victim then went to the toilet of the Accused’s flat to wash her anal cavity, experiencing a sharp pain as she did so, and she bled from her anal cavity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Victim cried from the pain but composed herself before stepping back out to the bedroom to complete the sexual services as agreed, as the Accused wanted the Victim to “finish the session”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The Accused then engaged in another round of penile-vaginal intercourse with the Victim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     On a related note, being a sex worker, the Victim was vulnerable. The courts have considered certain victims to be vulnerable, given their reluctance to come forward when offences are committed against them, for fear of compromising their illicit activities: <em>Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a> at [84] (see also the Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition: Volume I, LexisNexis, 2013) at page 834).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I was mindful that in assessing the level of harm or potential harm, the sentencing court should be careful not to double-count any factors which may already have been taken into account in assessing the level of culpability: <em>Ye Lin Myint</em> at [58], <em>Wong Chee Meng</em> at [57], and <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> at [56] (see also Andrew Ashworth, <em>Sentencing and Criminal Justice</em> (6<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2015, Cambridge University Press) at [4.3] and [4.5]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85      <b><u>Culpability</u></b> <b>.</b> There was medium culpability for the reasons set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     There was some planning and premeditation.

Interested please PM”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> (see also <em>Pram Nair at</em> [137(c)]).

Had the Accused arranged to meet the Victim at some other place unconnected to him and truly left no trace of his real identity, the position might be different, but those were not the facts before me: <em>AQW</em> at [61] (see generally, <em>Yap Lee Kok v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25827-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGHC 78</a> at [10]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Finally, the Accused faced a single charge, and the offence took place on a single day (<em>viz.</em> 11 August 2020).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Given the moderate level of harm and medium degree of culpability, and having regard to the full range of punishment prescribed under s 420A of the Penal Code, the appropriate starting point would be about 24 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Offender-specific factors </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The Accused had the following antecedents, which are discussed in greater detail below:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="10.7578484303139%"/> <col width="60.7678464307139%"/> <col width="28.4743051389722%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Year</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Offence</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sentence</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2003</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">s 420 Cap 224</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6 weeks</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2009</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">s 457 r/w s 511 r/w s 34 Cap 224</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 years</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2009</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">s 28(2)(a) r/w s 28(3)(a)(i) Moneylenders Act r/w 34 Cap 224</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 months and 2 strokes</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2019</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">s 323 Cap 224</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6 months and 4 weeks</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2019</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">s 27A(1)(a) Cap 184</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">Escalation principle</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The Escalation principle is no more than a reformulation of the longstanding principle that specific deterrence may justify a longer term of imprisonment being imposed on a persistent offender in light of his antecedents, if these reflected a tendency for repeat offending or a marked proclivity toward criminal offending: <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23982-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 769</a> at [56].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The appropriateness of escalation requires a scrupulous assessment of the particular factual matrix: <em>Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0010.xml')">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 10</a> at [34]. This is by no means a mechanical exercise. The court is required to assess whether the objective of preventing re-offending is in fact met by the use of escalation: <em>Low Ji Qing</em> at [66].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Applying the Escalation principle incorporates the safeguard of proportionality. Hence, before a court imposes an uplift on an accused person’s previous sentences, there must be a careful comparison with the accused person’s previous offending: <em>Low Ji Qing</em> at [74].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In order to have the correct factual basis for applying the Escalation principle, in addition to the Criminal Records Office record, it might sometimes be helpful or necessary to refer to, among other things, the charges, statement of facts, psychiatric reports, and grounds of decision (where available). It is not every case where this will be called for – but certainly where the Escalation principle is in play, a court should endeavour to have as complete a picture as practicable: <em>Low Ji Qing</em> at [76].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In this connection, I asked for and considered the charges, statement of facts, and mitigation plea pertaining to the Accused’s antecedents in 2003 and 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Ultimately, the assessment for the Escalation principle is necessarily a fact-specific and contextual one, requiring a judgment of experience and discernment: <em>Low Ji Qing</em> at [81].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In the present case, the Prosecution argued that the Escalation principle was engaged. The Prosecution “calibrated the accused’s offending as falling at the highest end of the spectrum, i.e. 3.5 years’ imprisonment” based on various aggravating factors, including his “related antecedents … The presence of relevant antecedents on the accused’s part is an aggravating factor because it signals a greater need for specific deterrence”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I considered that the Accused’s antecedents under s 420 of the Penal Code in 2003 were relevant (imprisonment for 6 weeks) but gave them less weight as these antecedents were dated – they took place more than 17 years ago when the Accused was 19 years old.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    For the Accused’s antecedents in 2019, the Prosecution’s submissions were forged on the anvil of social escorts as a leitmotif.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> I will deal with these antecedents in turn.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    For the charge of appearing nude in a public place under s 27A(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) where he was fined $2,000, the <em>gravamen</em> of the charge is clearly different from that under s 420A Cap 224. I did not give any weight to this antecedent.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Two of his s 323 Cap 224 charges in 2019 involved social escorts and the Accused punched them when they insisted on payment upfront before providing him with sexual services.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> I gave some weight to the Prosecution’s point that “the accused’s offending has now become more sophisticated. He has graduated from beating up his victims to now cheating them to slake his lust at their expense”, although I noted the different <em>gravamen</em> of the assault charges vis-à-vis his s 420A charge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>  In similar vein, I gave some weight to the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused “reoffended barely a year after his release from the sentence imposed for the Section 323 Penal Code offences against the social escorts”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In sum, I gave due weight to the Accused’s criminal record.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    As against his antecedents, the Accused pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and I gave due weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt: <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0653.xml')">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653</a> at [77]. His timeous guilty plea saved the criminal justice system resources that would have been expended with a full trial. Importantly, it spared the Victim from having to testify: <em>Logachev</em> at [67]-[68] and <em>Terence Ng</em> at [69].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    No restitution was made in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    On the whole, I was satisfied that an adjustment to 32 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. In my judgment, the aggravating factors would lead to a sentence of about 38 months’ imprisonment, but the mitigating factors would bring the calibrated sentence to 32 months’ imprisonment (see generally, <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em> at [130]). In the round, this appeared to be a proportionate sentence in all the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109     <u>Proportionality Principle.</u> I kept in mind the proportionality principle in sentencing: <em>Law Aik Meng</em> at [30]. Under the proportionality principle, the sentence to be imposed must not only bear a reasonable proportion to the maximum prescribed penalty, but also to the gravity of the offence committed (Kow Keng Siong, <em>Sentencing Principles in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at [06.091]-[06.093]) (see also Ho Hsi Ming Shawn, <em>The Centrality of Proportionality: A Golden Thread in Sentencing</em>, Singapore Law Gazette (July 2020)).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    All told, the Accused was sentenced to 32 months’ imprisonment backdated to 14 August 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    A summary of my Grounds of Decision is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_a"></a>(a)      <u>Offence-specific factors</u>.
