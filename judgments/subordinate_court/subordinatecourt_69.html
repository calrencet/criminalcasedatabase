District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerned an incident taking place in the estate of Serangoon Gardens. The Accused, a resident along Cowdray Avenue, claimed trial to three charges, in which he was alleged to have used insulting words on neighbours living along Bridport Avenue and also caused grievous hurt to one of them. At the outset of the trial, the charges read:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b><em>MCN 901983/2017</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>are charged that you, on 2 April 2017, at or about 4.45 a.m., in front of 8 Bridport Avenue, did with intent to cause harassment to Lee Phuay Hui (female/44 years old), did use insulting words, to wit, by uttering the words “Fucking” and “Bitch” to her, thereby causing her harassment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Chapter 256A.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b><em>MCN 901984/2017</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>are charged that you, on 2 April 2017, at or about 4.45 a.m., in front of 8 Bridport Avenue, did with intent to cause harassment to Grandclaudon Philippe (male/53 years old), did use insulting words, to wit, by uttering the words “you French, you think you can get away with everything” to him, thereby causing him harassment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”), Chapter 256A.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b><em>DCN 900005/2018</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>are charged that you, on 2 April 2017, at or about 4.55 a.m., along Cowdray Avenue, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Grandclaudon Philippe (male/53 years old), to wit, by hitting his neck and kicking his back at least once, which caused him to be, during the space of 27 days, unable to follow his ordinary pursuits, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 325 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentences Imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the two POHA charges (MCN 901983/2017 and MCN 901984/2017). As for DCN 900005/2018, I amended the charge to one under section 323 of the Penal Code and thereafter, found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the amended charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The following sentences were imposed:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     MCN 901983/2017 – A fine of $3,000 (in default 10 days’ imprisonment);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     MCN 901984/2017 – A fine of $3,000 (in default 10 days’ imprisonment);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     DCN 900005/2018 – Five months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The total sentence was five months’ imprisonment and a fine of $6,000 (in default 20 days’ imprisonment). The Accused was also ordered to pay a compensation sum of $5,470.85. The Accused has appealed against his conviction, sentence and the order of compensation.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Evidence of the Complainants</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Prosecution called a total of 11 witnesses, comprising of police officers, doctors as well as Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe (jointly referred to as “Complainants”). The evidence incriminating the Accused came mainly from PW4 Lee Phuay Hui (“Mdm Lee”) and her husband, PW5 Grandclaudon Philippe (“Mr Philippe”). I shall deal primarily with the evidence of the Complainants, beginning with Mdm Lee’s evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">PW4 Lee Phuay Hui</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mdm Lee, a housewife, 45 years old at the time of her evidence, testified that she had resided in 8 Bridport Avenue since 1977. After she married Mr Philippe in 2004, she continued to reside in 8 Bridport Avenue.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events on 1 April 2017</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 1 April 2017 at about 2 pm in the afternoon, Mdm Lee was talking to her husband, Mr Philippe outside their home at 8 Bridport Avenue when she noticed a man parking his car outside 5 Bridport Avenue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> After the man alighted from the vehicle, Mdm Lee told him that it may be dangerous to park there since he was parked next to a curve with a single white line in the centre. Despite the friendly and calm manner in which she had given the advice, the male subject ignored what Mdm Lee said and walked off, remarking that he “<em>also lives in the neighbourhood</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. In court, Mdm Lee positively identified the male subject to be the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mdm Lee then proceeded to walk to the coffeeshop to buy drinks for the construction workers who were renovating her house at that time. On her way there, she saw a Land Transport Authority (LTA) warden riding past her. She quickly ran home to inform her husband to get into the house, thinking that the Accused was going to think that she was the one who called for the LTA warden to fine him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After they both went back to the house, Mdm Lee noticed the Accused running back to his car and begin driving it in a “<em>very frantic dangerous way, doing a lot of three-point turns</em>” outside her neighbour’s gates<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. She observed that he finally parked his car outside 7 Bridport Avenue, which according to her was the “<em>correct place</em>” to park. However instead of walking away, the Accused got back into the car, stopped outside 8 Bridport Avenue, rolled down his window, stared at Mdm Lee and said: “<em>You like to call the police, ah”, with a kind of like warning tone and warning look</em>”. The Accused did not look happy and drove off<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mdm Lee testified that she was very shocked when the Accused did that. As far as she was concerned, when she gave the advice, she was trying to help him; to prevent him from being fined (which was the exact thing that would happen when the LTA officer arrived). She found the reaction of the Accused “<em>abnormal</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Mdm Lee confirmed that she did not know the Accused prior to the encounter on 1 April 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events on 2 April 2017</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the wee hours of the morning on 2 April 2017, as Mdm Lee was sleeping, she was awoken by a “<em>crack</em>” sound. She described this to be a sound like “<em>plastic hitting and breaking on the floor</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. As she went back to sleep, she heard the doorbell of her house going off: “<em>ting tong ting tong ting tong ting tong ting tong ting tong</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. The ringing did not stop. Thinking that it may be her tenant who had an emergency, Mdm Lee jumped out of bed, ran to the window and opened it, wanting to tell her tenant that she was coming. Instead, she heard a man’s voice shouting: “<em>You deserve it, you fucking bitch. You like to call the police, right</em>?”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The voice continued saying: “<em>You French, you French, you think you can get away with anything</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mdm Lee testified that she was shocked on hearing that. She recognised the voice to be of the Accused’s - the man from “<em>1<sup>st</sup> April 2:00 pm</em>”; the “<em>speech pattern is the same</em>”. The voice repeated: “<em>You call the police</em>” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. From the window on the second floor, Mdm Lee saw the Accused standing outside her house. She stated that the lighting was bright enough for her to see the person there<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. This was about 4:45 am. At this point, Mr Philippe asked Mdm Lee if she wanted him to find out where the Accused lived. After she said “<em>yes</em>”, he then went downstairs and followed the Accused whilst Mdm Lee changed out of her night clothes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was Mdm Lee’s evidence that as she was making her way out of the house with her bicycle, she almost tripped over a green rubbish bin on the compound of her house. The contents of the rubbish bin had spilled out; “<em>coffee, plastic, rubbish rotting food spilled all over the floor</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. Mdm Lee testified that this was not her rubbish bin - it was smelly and had its cover damaged by cigarette butts. She was convinced that this was a “<em>stolen rubbish bin</em>” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> from one of the shops opposite Chomp Food Centre. Mdm Lee’s rubbish bin was kept inside the house<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. Mdm Lee then called the police for help<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Thereafter, Mdm Lee got on her bicycle and rode down Bridport Avenue towards Bishops Place, having earlier noticed the Accused walking in that direction after shouting at her. She wanted to look for her husband, Mr Philippe. In her words, she got the “<em>biggest shock of her life</em>” when she saw Mr Philippe limping slowly along Bishops Place towards the junction of Bridport Avenue and Bishops Place. She observed that he had his hand to his back and could not walk properly. Mr Philippe then told her that “<em>he kicked me. He hit me. He kicked me when I was on the floor. He kicked me</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As Mdm Lee was trying to ascertain what had happened, the Accused appeared from the direction of Cowdray Avenue. She testified that she tried to deter him from approaching them by questioning him loudly but the Accused continued to advance. Subsequently, the Accused took out his handphone and started taking pictures of them saying: “<em>Ah hah, this is the famous couple, I am going to make you famous</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. The Accused’s behaviour was “<em>very intimidating</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe then quickly headed towards 8 Bridport Avenue and she made another call to the police on her way home. The ambulance and police arrived at her home later.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Photographs taken by Mdm Lee</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the course of her testimony, Mdm Lee produced photographs which she had taken on 2 April 2017:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     Photographs of the injuries suffered by her husband Mr Philippe at various parts of the body (Photos P5 -1 to P5-8);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Photographs of the general scene at 8 Bridport Avenue, including that of the green rubbish bin on the ground with rubbish strewn on the compound of 8 Bridport Avenue and near vehicle SDD 4590T, the two rubbish bins belonging to Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe, and the scene after the police arrived in the morning of 2 April 2017 (photos collectively marked as P4).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In her mind, Mdm Lee took the photographs because she felt that this was like a “<em>crime scene</em>” and she wanted to “<em>preserve the pictures, so that it’s easier to explain what happened</em>”. It was in pictures that details are noticed and Mdm Lee felt that was important<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. She similarly took photographs of her husband’s injuries so as to “<em>record his injuries</em>” since she did not know how badly injured he was and thought it was best for her to capture them lest she missed anything when explaining to the doctors<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. In court, Mdm Lee also testified of the nature and extent of Mr Philipp’s injuries following the incident on 2 April 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">PW5 Philippe Grandclaudon</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr Philippe, a French citizen, was 52 years old and an engineer with LTA at the time of this incident. He had been married to Mdm Lee since 2004 but had only been living in 8 Bridport Avenue since 2013 due to the demands of his work.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events on 1 April 2017</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr Philippe similarly encountered the Accused on the afternoon of 1 April 2017. He noticed that a male subject, subsequently identified to be the Accused, had parked his car along Bridport Avenue where there was a curve and a single white line in the centre. After he got out of the car, Mr Philippe informed him that the LTA did regular patrols in the area and that he “<em>may get fined</em>”. However, the Accused replied something to the extent of “<em>I’m from the neighbourhood, no worry</em>”, showed a thumbs up to Mr Philippe as he walked past in front of Mr Philippe and headed in the direction of Porchester Avenue<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Subsequently. Mr Philippe noticed an LTA officer arrive on motorcycle at Bridport Avenue. At this point, Mdm Lee also returned (from wanting to buy tea) and said to him to go into the house, remarking that the Accused was going to say that they were the ones who had called for the LTA. Shortly, he noticed the Accused rushing back to his vehicle and moving it in what appeared to be a “<em>panicky</em>” manner. Mr Philippe testified that initially, the Accused re-parked his car in front of 7 Bridport Avenue but later, he drove it in front of 8 Bridport Avenue where Mr Philippe and his wife were standing behind its gates, rolled down his window and said: “<em>You call the police? You call the police?”</em> before driving off<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. Mr Philippe added that the tone used by the Accused was “<em>not friendly for sure</em>”, even “<em>a bit aggressive…….a bit threatening</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events on 2 April 2017</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Mr Philippe testified that as he was sleeping that night, he was awoken by a very loud noise, like that of an object falling on the floor, followed by the repeated ringing of the doorbell. When he opened the front window to look, he heard the words “<em>You deserve it, you fucking bitch. You bitch, bitch, bitch”; “Yah, you French, you can do anything you want. You French, you French</em>”. The volume was loud and although Mr Philippe could not really see the face of the person shouting these words, he recognised it to be the voice of the same person whom he encountered in the afternoon<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It was Mr Philippe’s evidence that he then turned to his wife Mdm Lee and asked her if she wanted him to follow the Accused to see where he lived, since by the time the police arrived, he (the Accused) might already be very far away. In his mind, the Accused was aggressive and was anti-French and if so, it might also be better for them to know who he is and where exactly he lived so that he could be advised by the police<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Mdm Lee agreed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mr Philippe then put on his shorts and went after the Accused. After some distance, Mr Philippe located the Accused; he saw him entering 78 Cowdray Avenue. At some point, the Accused noticed Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Encounter between Mr Philippe and the Accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Upon noticing him, the Accused came out of the house and ran after Mr Philippe, who was by this time running away from the Accused and quite out of breath. After the Accused caught up with Mr Philippe and stood in front of him, he used his fist and hit Mr Philippe at the region of the head behind his left ear. The Accused then goaded him to retaliate by saying “<em>Touch me, touch me</em>” but Mr Philippe did not do anything. Thereafter, the Accused used his fist and hit him on the other side of the head, in the same region behind the right ear. Mr Philippe testified that he temporarily blacked out on both occasions and was partly knocked down on the second occasion<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Philippe then tried to move to retrieve his glasses which had flown off his face after the Accused’s first punch. At this time, the Accused ran towards his glasses and according to Mr Philippe, he “<em>stomped</em>” on them at the same time, smiling<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. After the Accused moved away, Mr Philippe grabbed his glasses off the floor, stood up and turned to run away. It was unclear to him what happened but as he did so, he fell forward and felt a burning sensation to his left shin and his palm was painful. Mr Philippe remained on the floor, on his left side. The Accused was behind him. Thereafter, he felt a kick in his back and felt a “<em>horrible pain</em>” in his back<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> which started radiating from his left hip to his entire back. When Mr Philippe noticed that the Accused was approaching him, seemingly to kick him again, he decided to shout as loud as he could. The Accused then left and went back into his house.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mr Philippe then tried to walk back towards Bridport and that was when his wife arrived on the bicycle. Shortly after he met Mdm Lee, the Accused appeared again. Mr Philippe testified that the Accused who was initially approaching Mdm Lee, stopped, took out his mobile phone and said something like: “<em>This is the famous couple. I am going to make you famous</em>”. The Accused looked like he was recording them or taking pictures<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. Thereafter, the Accused decided to leave and went back into his house. Mr Philippe and Mdm Lee then returned to 8 Bridport Avenue.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Injuries suffered by Mr Philippe </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Mr Philippe was seen by several doctors for the injuries he suffered, for which he was prescribed various medication as well as received medical certificates (“MCs”) covering extended periods of time. The main complaint of Mr Philippe was the pain he suffered on his lower back as a result of the kick by the Accused. In court, Mr Philippe gave a detailed description of the pain he experienced in his back and the difficulty he had with simple and daily activities<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. The inability of Mr Philippe to follow his ordinary pursuits for 27 days (the entire period being covered by various medical certificates) was the basis of the charge under section 325 of the Penal Code. I shall deal with this aspect of the case, along with the doctors’ evidence, in the later part of these written grounds.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Close of the Prosecution’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Prosecution made an application to amend MCN 901984/2017 (amendments underlined) to read:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>You, Kumaaran s/o Kalimuthu, are charged that you, on 2 April 2017, at or about 4.45 a.m., in front of 8 Bridport Avenue, did with intent to cause harassment to Grandclaudon Philippe (male/53 years old), did use insulting words, to wit, by uttering the words to him</em>, <em><u>“you French, you can do anything you want”, or words to that effect</u></em>, <em>thereby causing him harassment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Chapter 256A.</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     An application was similarly made to amend DCN 900005/2018 (amendments underlined) to read:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>You, Kumaaran s/o Kalimuthu, are charged that you, on 2 April 2017, at or about 4.55 a.m.</em>, <em><u>along Bishops Place</u></em><em>, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Grandclaudon Philippe (male/53 years old), to wit, by hitting his neck and kicking his back at least once, which caused him to be, during the space of 27 days, unable to follow his ordinary pursuits, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 325 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Leave was granted accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Evidence of the Accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I next turn to the version offered by the Accused in respect of the events on 1 and 2 April 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Accused does not deny that he did meet the Complainants on 1 April 2017. He testified that in the afternoon of 1 April 2017, he drove and parked his car at Bridport Avenue as he wanted to check the queue at the barber which was at the “<em>foot of the Bridport Avenue</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. He saw Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe (whom he described as the “<em>Eurasian man</em>”) standing opposite their house. After he alighted from the car, Mr Philippe remarked: “<em>You’re not supposed to park here</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>, to which the Accused showed him a thumbs up, smiled and walked on. Five minutes later, the Accused returned to his car, did a 3-point turn and went home since the queue at the barber was long. He informed the Court that he did not drive recklessly or see any LTA warden when he did so. He did not speak to the Complainants thereafter or had any reason to be angry with them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On 2 April 2017 at about 4 am, as the Accused was walking home along the right-hand side pavement of Bridport Avenue, he accidentally knocked into a bin. He was using his mobile phone and was listening to his music with the earpiece at that time. He knocked into the bin, caused it to stumble and in the process, it hit the gate and fell on the floor. It made a loud noise when the bin hit the gate and fell on the floor<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Before the Accused could pick the bin up, he heard somebody shouting loudly: “<em>Hey!</em>” The noise came from the second floor of the house where he noticed a man and a lady. The Accused testified that the man was shouting: “<em>Hey you, what the fuck are you trying to do? You fucker….You Indian blackie, you wait there</em>” whilst the lady shouted: “<em>Hey you. You, ah, you, ah…. You, blackie. You, blackie. Wait there</em>.” The Accused retaliated by shouting back “<em>Who you calling a In….blackie? Get lost</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> before walking away in the direction of home at Cowdray Avenue, where he had been living since he was born. On the stand, the Accused denied ringing the doorbell of 8 Bridport Avenue and denied that he had said the offending words to Mdm Lee or Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Continuing his way along Bridport Avenue, the Accused heard somebody shout “<em>Stop</em>”. He turned around and noticed Mr Philippe following him. He decided to walk faster because he did not want Mr Philippe to catch up with him. Subsequently, at around the first house along Bishops Place, he felt somebody grabbing his collar from the back. The Accused turned around and saw that it was Mr Philippe. The action of Mr Philippe was unexpected and the Accused testified that he panicked, turned around and gave Mr Philippe’s hand a hard push in order to make him let go of his collar. Mr Philippe fell backwards.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Accused stated that he was in a state of panic and anxiety and did not see how Mr Philippe fell. He did not see Mr Philippe’s spectacles fly off. In his evidence, the Accused denied punching Mr Philippe, stamping on his spectacles, kicking him on his back when he was on the ground. In the course of his evidence, the Accused produced Photos P6-1 to P6-3. He testified that he tried to take some pictures on his mobile phone as evidence. However, they turned out unclear because he was in a state of panic and could not compose himself to take a proper picture. Further, Mr Philippe was in motion as he was running away. The Accused denied that he said anything about the Complainants being the “<em>famous couple</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     After he had taken pictures of Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe, the Accused went home. He thought the matter was settled and did not see the need to call the police at that time. Subsequently, the matter became a police case. In his statements to the police (Exhibits D1, D2 and D3), the Accused denied that he committed the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Credibility of the Complainants</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Prosecution’s case rested mainly on the evidence of the Complainants.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Having heard and assessed the evidence of Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe, I found both of them to be credible witnesses. I was satisfied that their testimonies were borne out of a personal experience with the events on 1 April 2017 as well as 2 April 2017. Their accounts were not contrived; neither were their answers in cross-examination and their evidence remained unshaken during cross-examination. Their seemingly over-dramatisation of the events and their responses, often criticised by the Defence to be exaggeration and embellishment, did to some degree, lent credence to their testimonies and demonstrated their candour and spontaneity in relation to the incidents which took place on 1 and 2 April. I did not find the manner in which Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe had given their testimonies to detract from the truth of what they had personally experienced viz-a-viz the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Complainants’ accounts were clear, logical and coherent</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe’s individual and separate accounts of their encounter with the Accused over the parking incident as well as of the events which occurred in the early morning of 2 April were clear, coherent and logical. They gave their evidence in a straightforward manner.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Complainants’ claims against the Accused were not without basis. The parking incident on 1 April 2017 constituted the first encounter between the parties. From the Complainants’ account of the incident, it appeared that the Accused was unhappy with them, thinking that they were the ones who had called for the LTA warden because of the way he had parked his car. The Accused’s misconception of the situation explained why he drove up to the Complainants at 8 Bridport Avenue and even spoke to them in an aggressive manner, accusing them of calling the police. Based on Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe’s account of their encounter with the Accused in the afternoon on 1 April 2017, there was a basis for the Accused’s aggression and retaliation on the early morning of 2 April 2017 in the manner as described by the Complainants, even if such reaction was wholly disproportionate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Further, the words shouted towards the Complainants that early morning bore an uncanny co-relation to the parking incident in the afternoon between the Accused and the Complainants since it talked about “calling the police”. As Prosecution submitted, there was a “<em>logical connection</em>” between the insulting words used by the Accused and the incident on 1 April 2017<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. On the other hand, it would have been bewildering had the Complainants testified that it was a stranger who was shouting the offending words and ringing the doorbell of 8 Bridport Avenue that early morning. Even though the couple and the Accused lived in the same estate of Serangoon Gardens for some years, they were not known to each other prior to 1 April 2017. There was no basis to suggest that Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe were making up stories against the Accused in respect of both or either of the incidents on 1 and 2 April 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     If the Accused’s account was to be believed (that there was no unpleasant encounter which took place between the couple and him over the parking incident the day before and he had merely stumbled over the dustbin as he was walking along Bridport Avenue that early morning), it would be far-fetched to suggest that Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe had hurled racial abuse at the Accused just because of a fallen dustbin and then took it even further by concocting a tall story to falsely incriminate the Accused and thereafter maintaining their stance all the way to trial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I was also doubtful of the claim by the Accused that the Complainants had called him “<em>blackie</em>” after he stumbled over the dustbin. This was clearly a racist term. I was not too troubled by the fact that the Accused did not make a police report about it even though it was something he claimed he could not forget or was upsetting<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, as it was not unthinkable that a person in the Accused’s shoes might not choose to make a police report about it, especially if there was nothing more to the incident. Prosecution also submitted that the Accused had a chance to tell his side of the story to PW6 Sgt Edwin Chau (Sgt Chau) when the police officer paid a visit to the Accused’s home in the morning of 2 April 2017. However, there was in fact no meeting between Sgt Chau and the Accused that morning. Sgt Chau testified that despite ringing the doorbell for a few minutes, nobody came to the door<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. The Accused’s evidence was that he did not hear any ringing of the doorbell<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. There was no clear evidence that the Accused had heard the doorbell and had deliberately avoided answering the door.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Whilst I may be able to accept that the Accused chose not to be bothered by the verbal abuse on him, what was unusual was the fact that the Accused made no mention of it in his police statement (P28) dated 5 June 2017. The Accused explained that he “<em>didn’t want to make it a big issue</em>” and just talked about the “<em>basics</em>” in the statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>. In my mind, even if it was true that the Accused did not want to make a big issue of the racial remarks hurled at him, it would have been appropriate to make mention of it in in the police statement since he was describing the events of 2 April 2017 viz-a-viz the Complainants. Even if it was not a big issue to the Accused, if it did in fact happen, it would not have been forgotten or overlooked. Yet, the first mention of these claims against the Complainants only arose in his cautioned statements (D1 and D2) recorded a few months later. I found the claims against the Complainants to be an afterthought on the part of the Accused in an attempt to paint himself as a victim of the Complainants’ purported aggression.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">No Mistake as to Identity</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe testified that it was the Accused they saw at their gate that early morning. Even though they only initially heard the words shouted by a male voice which matched the voice of the person they had encountered in the afternoon earlier, each of them did subsequently see the Accused standing outside their house. There was no mistake in terms of the identity of the person who shouted the offending words. In any case, there was no suggestion by the Defence that the Accused was not in the vicinity of 8 Bridport Avenue on 2 April 2017 at about 4 plus am. The only disagreement was in respect of what transpired between Mdm Lee, Mr Philippe and the Accused at that material time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The collective evidence of Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe also pointed to the Accused as the one most likely to have thrown the green rubbish bin over the gate of 8 Bridport Avenue, spilling rubbish all over the porch as well as the one who repeatedly rang the doorbell in the wee hours of the morning, since the street then was “<em>completely empty</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. There was no one else on Bridport Avenue, except for the Accused. On the evidence, it would also not be inherently incredible for the Accused to have been able to do throw the green dustbin over the gate of 8 Bridport Avenue, as Defence submitted<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Complainants’ testimonies were consistent with each other </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Apart from similar experiences in respect of the parking incident on 1 April 2017, I agreed with the Prosecution that the testimonies of Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe with regards to the incident on the early morning of 2 April 2017 were largely consistent with each other in material aspects, lending corroboration to each other’s version of events.

However, having considered the testimonies of Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe, I was satisfied that there was no such collusion. From the manner in which they had given their testimonies as well as the details they were able to describe, I was convinced that each of them had given a personal account of what they had heard and seen on 2 April 2017 after they were both awoken by a sound they heard in the night. They described the events in their own manner, yet the essence of their accounts remained largely consistent with each other. Their evidence was recounted with ease and from a personal experience.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Corroborative Evidence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 999 call</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     There was corroborative evidence of Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe’s version of events in the form of the first “999” call made by Mdm Lee at 4.58 am on 2 April 2017, shortly after Mr Philippe went after the Accused. The contents of her call stated “<em>a guy whom I got to know yesterday came over and pressed my doorbell. He also scolded me with vulgarities and threw a rubbish bin at my gate. My family members are going after him now</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>. Importantly, the contents of her call established her association with the Accused arising from the incident on 1 April 2017, corroborated her testimony of the Accused pressing the doorbell, throwing the rubbish bin and hurling insulting words at her. It also confirmed that Mr Philippe did go after the Accused that morning. The proximity of time in terms of the call and the incident on 2 April 2017 made it plain that the events Mdm Lee experienced and testified of in court could not have been fabricated.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     When police officers responded to the “999” call and arrived at 8 Bridport Avenue, PW6 Sgt Chau testified that Mdm Lee recounted to him what had happened and he saw the rubbish bin which had been thrown inside the car porch area, beside the parked car<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Photographs of the scene at 8 Bridport Avenue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Numerous photographs taken by Mdm Lee and the police photographer (PW2 Sgt Tan Shu Xuan – “Sgt Tan”) on the morning of 2 April 2017 showed the general scene of the porch of 8 Bridport Avenue as well as a green dustbin resting on its side with its contents spilled on the porch. The scene of 8 Bridport Avenue supported the Complainants’ version of events and their theory that a dustbin had been thrown over the gate onto their front porch, which woke both of them up that early morning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     These photographs of the front porch of 8 Bridport Avenue (Photos P4-1 to P4-4) and the rubbish bins were taken by Mdm Lee immediately after Mr Philippe and her arrived home on 2 April 2017, at about 4:55 am<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. The photographs were verified by the date stamps on the bottom right of the photographs. In the night of 2 April 2017 at about 8:48 pm, Mdm Lee took additional photographs of the scene, when the police were present (Photos P4-5 to P4-14). In the course of her evidence, Mdm Lee provided cogent reasons why she had taken the photographs. The fact that Mdm Lee was a person of detail who made the effort to ensure she had a record of all that she experienced and/or encountered was recognised by the Defence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. This also meant that precious evidence were retained in the form of contemporaneous photographs taken by Mdm Lee. Sgt Tan further confirmed that she had taken photographs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> of the scene which greeted her at 8 Bridport Avenue at about 8:30 pm on 2 April 2017 as part of the police party. I found these photographs to be credible pieces of evidence which corroborated Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe’s testimonies in court.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings on POHA Charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Being satisfied that the Complainants were credible witnesses, I proceeded to consider whether the ingredients in the POHA charges had been made out.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As rightly stated by the Prosecution, for the POHA charges, the Prosecution had to prove the following elements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the Accused had used insulting words on both Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the Accused had the intent to cause harassment when he used the insulting words on each of them;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_c"></a>(c)     That harassment was caused to Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">MCN 901983/2017</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Having considered and accepted the evidence of the Complainants, I was satisfied that the offending words “<em>fucking</em>” and “<em>bitch</em>” used in the sentence “<em>You deserve it, you fucking bitch. You like to call the police, right</em>?” uttered by the Accused that morning were directed at Mdm Lee, and were clearly insulting in nature. The choice of words was in itself sufficient for the court to infer an intent on the part of the Accused to cause harassment to Mdm Lee; the conduct of the Accused in throwing the rubbish bin into Mdm Lee’s home and the act of ringing the doorbell incessantly served to reinforce such intent on the his part. On her part, Mdm Lee testified that she was very shocked and worried<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. Harassment was caused to her.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">MCN 901984/2017</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As for the charge involving Mr Philippe, the words “<em>You French, you can do anything you want</em>” or words to that effect, used by the Accused, were clearly directed at Mr Philippe - a French citizen. As the Prosecution put it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>, the choice of words by the Accused targeted Mr Philippe’s nationality and had racist undertones since the words “<em>can do anything you want</em>” implied that because Mr Philippe was French, he was superior and above the law. I found that these words were intended to cause Mr Philippe harassment and it did cause harassment. Mr Philippe testified that he was shocked, afraid and felt that the words used were racist as well as aggressive<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The slight discrepancy in the precise words spoken by the Accused, as testified by Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe did not trouble me. I found that the essence of the words uttered, as remembered by Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe, was consistent in that the words used implied that Mr Philippe being French could do anything he wanted and get away with it. I agreed with the Prosecution that such discrepancy could be attributed to human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection and in any case, it was a minor discrepancy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. In this regard, since the words were directed at Mr Philippe, I was comfortable accepting that his recollection of the words used may be more accurate than Mdm Lee’s - his evidence thus formed the particulars of the POHA charge as drafted by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence of Reasonable Conduct</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Accused’s defence against the POHA charges was one of denial. In their closing submissions, the Defence made an alternative submission that the Accused may rely on the defence of reasonable conduct under section 3(3) of POHA. In this respect, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused would not be able to avail himself of the defence of reasonable conduct since the Accused denied even uttering the offending words in both of the charges. In any case, since the Accused’s defence throughout the trial was one of denial, there had been no endeavor on the part of the Defence to show that the Accused’s conduct at the material time was reasonable in the circumstances. I could not accept this submission by Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Based on the evidence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt on the two POHA charges.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings on the section 325 Penal Code charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     For an offence to be made out on this charge, the Prosecution needed to prove the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the hurt was caused voluntarily;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the Accused intended to cause or knew that he was likely to cause grievous hurt; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_c"></a>(c)     That the hurt caused was grievous hurt, in that Mr Philippe was, during the space of 20 days, unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In respect of the facts involved in this charge, I accepted Mr Philippe’s evidence. His testimony that he had gone after the Accused so that he could find out where the Accused lived in order to make a police report was believable and was a reasonable response to the behavior displayed by the Accused. In his further encounter with the Accused, Mr Philippe testified that the Accused hit his head, once behind the left ear and another time behind the right ear. As Mr Philippe was running away from the Accused, he fell forward. As he was on the ground on his left, he felt the Accused give him a kick on his back, resulting in pain which radiated from his left hip to his entire back.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The corroborative evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Mr Philippe’s account of his assault by the Accused, in particular how he was kicked in the back by him, was corroborated by these following pieces of evidence:-</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mdm Lee testified that when she subsequently met up with Mr Philippe on her bicycle, she noticed him limping towards her. She also observed that he had his hand on his back. Mr Philippe’s immediate complaint to Mdm Lee was that the Accused had kicked him when he was on the floor;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_b"></a>(b)     The photographs of Mr Philippe taken with the Accused’s handphone (P6) although unclear, showed Mr Philippe holding his left lower back with his hand;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_c"></a>(c)     The photographs taken of Mr Philippe by a detail-oriented Mdm Lee right after the incident showed injuries which were consistent with Mr Philippe’s account. Significantly, there was a visible injury on the left lower back of Mr Philippe as could be seen in photographs P5-7 and P5-8;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_d"></a>(d)     When Sgt Chau arrived at 8 Bridport Avenue, Mr Philippe informed him of his injuries. Sgt Chau also independently observed that Mr Philippe had some bleeding and abrasion on the leg area or knee, some bruising at the back area, some redness on the hands<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_e"></a>(e)     The medical evidence, through various doctors, supported Mr Philippe’s version of the assault, in particular his lower back pain.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The medical evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I now turn to consider the medical evidence in greater detail. The Prosecution dealt with the medical evidence comprehensively in their submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>, portions of which are set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The first medical report was put up by Dr Thomas Catabas (Exhibit P20), based on PW 10 Dr Lim Wei Khoon’s (“Dr Lim”) clinical examination of Mr Philippe at the Emergency Department of TTSH on 2 April 2017 at about 6:45 am. Dr Lim gave a detailed account of his examination of Mr Philippe in court<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> which corroborated Mr Philippe’s account of where on his body he was attacked, how he had fallen which resulted in the corresponding injuries to his hands, left knee, leg and ankle, left shoulder and lower back. Dr Lim also testified that he was satisfied that the injuries he had examined were consistent with the patient history. In addition, Mr Philippe’s account of how the Accused had attacked him was also largely consistent with the patient history which was conveyed to PW9 Dr Wong Him Choon David (“Dr Wong”) who examined him subsequently on 11 and 25 April 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The doctors who had examined Mr Philippe subsequently, i.e. PW7 Dr Tan Yeow Meng and Dr Wong from Raffles Hospital, also found that Philippe had lower back pain which was “<em>mechanical in nature</em>”, i.e. pain which is aggravated by movement but relieved when sitting down<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. This back pain had persisted over the course of his visits to these two doctors. Dr Wong also clarified in his second medical report dated 23 February 2018 that the pain to Philippe’s back only started after the attack.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Overall, the findings of injury on Mr Philippe by various doctors were consistent with Mr Philippe’s version that he was kicked on the lower back which caused him great pain.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The medical evidence offered by the Defence in the form of DW2 Professor Tay Boon Keng (“Prof Tay”) did not directly contradict the Prosecution's medical evidence. Looking at the injury, Prof Tay testified that blunt trauma by way of a kick to the back or a fall to the left lower back of Mr Philippe could have likely resulted in the injury to the back. Prof Tay further agreed with the Prosecution that if a person were to fall on his left side, the injury would be on the left flank of the body where the waist is, even though he was eventually unable to draw a firm conclusion either way<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. As pointed out by the Prosecution in its submissions, the opinion of Prof Tay in this regard appeared to be consistent with the evidence of Dr Wong who had opined that the injury on Mr Philippe’s back would have been “<em>unusual</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> if he had merely fallen down<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I found that the medical evidence did support Mr Philippe’s account that the Accused had kicked him on his back whilst he was lying on his left side on the ground, having fallen down when trying to get away from the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Although no injuries were detected on the back of Mr Philippe’s head where he was hit, I agreed with the Prosecution that that did not mean that the assault did not happen. On the evidence and accepting Mr Philippe’s account of his encounter with the Accused, I was satisfied that the Accused did hit Mr Philippe in his head once behind the left ear and another time behind the right ear.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Grievous hurt was caused </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The charge of causing grievous hurt to Mr Philippe was premised on the fact that Mr Philippe was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits during the space of 27 days, based on the number of days of medical leave given to him. There was no dispute from the Defence that the cumulative number of days of medical leave given would amount to 27 days; what was in dispute was whether the medical leave was justified.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Medical Leave of 27 days was justified</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Based on the medical evidence, I was satisfied that the hurt caused by the Accused in kicking Mr Philippe in his back had caused him to be unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for a period of more than 20 days<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>. A total of 27 days of medical leave was issued to Mr Philippe by doctors on account of his back pain. This essentially meant that Mr Philippe would not have been able to go to work – an “ordinary pursuit”. On Mr Philippe’s own evidence, he did not go back to work during the period of 2 April to 28 April 2017 and had difficulty with daily activities. He testified that he could barely walk, could not go up or down stairs, getting into the car was difficult, “<em>sitting …almost impossible</em>”; he had to sleep on his back for three weeks and he could not sit for long periods of time<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>. The poor physical state of Mr Philippe was amply corroborated by Mdm Lee<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> as well as the doctors who had observed him during consultation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>. There was no basis for the Defence’s submission that Mr Philippe had exaggerated his back pain.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It was agreed amongst the doctors called as witnesses that the number of days of medical leave given to any patient is an exercise of the doctor’s discretion, dependent on the patient’s history, clinical examination, investigation, estimated recovery of the patient et cetera. I agreed with the Prosecution that each of the doctors involved in granting medical leave to Mr Philippe had given cogent and clear testimony on how they had examined Mr Philippe and had acted in accordance with their judgment to issue the appropriate period of medical leave to Mr Philippe<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>. Again, there was no basis to suggest that any of the doctors had not acted in good faith or had misapplied their mind and expertise in relation to their examination of Mr Philippe as a patient. As for the 18 days of medical leave issued by Dr Wong, Prof Tay conceded that Dr Wong would be the best person to justify the amount of leave given, since Dr Wong was the one who had seen and examined Mr Philippe personally<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On the strength of the evidence surrounding Mr Philippe’s injury, I also found that there was no basis for the following suggestions:-</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     That Mdm Lee and Mr Philippe had chosen to continue treatment for Mr Philippe with Dr Wong at Raffles Hospital because Dr Wong had treated Mdm Lee before<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>. On the evidence, it was Dr Tan who had referred Mr Philippe to Dr Wong<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>. It was also baseless to suggest that the number of days of medical leave furnished to Mr Philippe by Dr Wong was because of a prior relationship between Mr Philippe and/or Mdm Lee with Dr Wong;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     That Mdm Lee had influenced Mr Philippe to exaggerate the pain he felt and to obtain a longer medical leave period so as to satisfy the definition of grievous hurt in the Penal Code<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_c"></a>(c)     That Dr Wong was liberal with issuing medical certificates (MCs) following a Disciplinary Tribunal initiated by the Singapore Medical Council and a subsequent appeal to the High Court<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>. This was highly speculative.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I agreed with the Prosecution that the greatest limitation to Prof Tay’s expert medical report was the fact that he did not see or examine Mr Philippe or had any access to the doctors’ case notes. The Prosecution had also highlighted inaccurate premises on which his opinion was based on<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span>. I preferred the evidence of Mr Philippe’s attending doctors over the expert report of Prof Tay.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pre-existing condition of degenerative disc disease</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     PW8 Dr Henry Oscar confirmed that Mr Philippe suffered from a degenerative disc disease<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>. However, the fact that Mr Philippe had a pre-existing condition of degenerative disc disease did not absolve the Accused from the full extent of the pain and injury suffered by Mr Philippe. Regardless of whether the disc protrusion was a result of a kick or whether it resulted naturally from the degenerative disc disease which Mr Philippe suffered from (medical evidence being inconclusive), what was clear was that the kick which the Accused gave to Mr Philippe’s lower back caused pain which would have been aggravated due to Mr Philippe’s back condition. But for the kick given to Mr Philippe by the Accused, Mr Philippe would not have suffered the hurt which caused him to be unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for a period of more than 20 days. I was satisfied of the causative link between the Accused’s act of kicking Mr Philippe and the extent of injury suffered by Mr Philippe which caused him to be unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for at least 20 days.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">No intention to cause grievous hurt</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     A key ingredient of this charge that the Prosecution needed to prove was that the Accused intended to cause grievous hurt to Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In <em>Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21768-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 116</a>, Sundaresh Menon, CJ stated at [42]:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“Thus, the mental element required for an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt is that the accused actually intended grievous hurt to result from his actions or knew that it was likely that grievous hurt would so result. The inquiry is as to the accused person's subjective state of mind…..</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>……The law may require that the accused possess certain subjective states of mind for the purposes of an offence, but that does not mean that the accused’s intention and knowledge cannot be judged and inferred from his objective conduct and all the surrounding circumstances. Barring a personal admission by the accused, this will often be the only way to ascertain his state of mind.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     This was the hurdle which I found the Prosecution could not cross. Notwithstanding the foregoing and even accepting the Prosecution’s version of how the physical assault on Mr Philippe had taken place that early morning of 2 April 2017, I had some difficulty finding that the Accused had intended to cause grievous hurt to Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     An intention to cause grievous hurt would be gleaned from the facts and circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the Accused, the amount of violence used, the use of weapons and the choice of weapons, the part of the body where hurt was inflicted. In this case, whilst there was evidence that the Accused did intend to cause hurt to Mr Philippe by hitting his head area behind both the left and right ear and by kicking him on his back when he was on the ground, there were no circumstances that could lead me to draw an inference that the Accused had intended to cause hurt of a grievous nature to Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Taking the Prosecution’s case at its highest based on Mr Philippe’s own account – Mr Philippe could only be sure that he had been hit once on the head behind the left ear and once on the head behind the right ear and only kicked once on his back. in respect of the injury caused by the kick to Mr Philippe’s back which was the cause of the grievous hurt, there was no evidence that the Accused had done anything more to Mr Philippe’s back other than just kicking him once. There was no conclusive medical evidence on the force of the kick in this instance. There would have been no way the Accused would have known that Mr Philippe had a degenerative disc condition which would be aggravated by a kick to the back or that the Accused had specifically targeted the left lower region of Mr Philippe’s back. No weapons were used in the attack on Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     On the evidence, I found that there was a reasonable doubt whether the Accused had intended to cause grievous hurt to Mr Philippe by kicking him on his back or knew that the kick he gave Mr Philippe would be likely to cause grievous hurt. Even if I were to consider the Accused’s overall assault on Mr Philippe that night, I was not satisfied that the Accused had intended to cause hurt of a grievous nature to Mr Philippe or knew that what he did was likely to cause grievous hurt to him.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Amendment of the charge under section 128 Criminal Procedure Code</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     On consideration of the evidence and being satisfied that the Accused did intend to cause hurt to Mr Philippe, I exercised my power under section 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code to amend the charge under section 325 of the Penal Code to one under section 323 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The amended charge read:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>You, Kumaaran S/O Kalimuthu… are charged that you, on 2 April 2017, at or about 4.55 a.m., along Cowdray Avenue<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span>, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Grandclaudon Philippe (male/53 years old), to wit, by hitting him once in the region of his head behind his left ear, hitting him once in the region of his head behind his right ear and kicking his back once, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Given the evidence led on the original section 325 Penal Code charge and the areas of dispute, I was satisfied that there would not be any prejudice caused to the Accused by the amendment of the charge. There was also no application by either the Prosecution or the Defence to recall any witnesses nor were there any further submissions in respect of the amended charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion of trial</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Upon consideration of the totality of evidence in this case, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt on the two POHA charges as well as the amended charge under section 323 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on all three charges.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     To reiterate, the following sentences were imposed:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     MCN 901983/2017 – A fine of $3,000 (in default 10 days’ imprisonment);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     MCN 901984/2017 – A fine of $3,000 (in default 10 days’ imprisonment);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_c"></a>(c)     DCN 900005/2018 – Five months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">POHA charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The Accused was a first offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The punishment prescribed for an offence under section 3(2) POHA is a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or to both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The Prosecution sought a high fine on each of the two charges. I agreed that the facts surrounding the POHA charges did not cross the custodial threshold. The offending words used were not exceptionally insulting, save that it made reference to Mr Philippe’s nationality. The verbal abuse was also not sustained in nature. However, taking into account the Accused’s conduct in throwing the rubbish bin into the Complainant’s porch as well as the repeated ringing of their doorbell which preceded the use of these offending words hurled in the wee hours of the morning, I was of the view that a mid-range fine of $3,000 on each charge would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 323 charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The punishment prescribed for this offence was a fine up to $5,000, or imprisonment which may extend to 3 years or to both fine and jail.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The sentencing framework for offences under section 323 of the Penal Code for first-time offenders who pleaded guilty was laid down in <em>Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23956-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 526</a> at [77]:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="11.2777444511098%"/> <col width="56.2287542491502%"/> <col width="32.4935012997401%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Hurt Caused</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Indicative Sentencing Range</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to four weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalization or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks to six months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Both Prosecution and Defence made reference to this framework in their submissions but arrived at very different final positions. The Prosecution sought a custodial term of at least six months’ imprisonment whilst the Defence asked the court to impose a “<em>heavy fine</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> instead of imposing a custodial term.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mr Philippe is to be taken as he is</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Before applying the sentencing framework to the facts of this case, I began with the position that Mr Philippe should be taken as he is. In <em>Bong Sim Swan Suzanna v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24096-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 15</a> at [48], the High Court stated that the ‘thin skull’ rule was a relevant consideration in sentencing offenders for causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code. The Court went on to say that all this rule does “<em>is to allow the court to take into account the full extent of the harm caused by a particular criminal act, even though part of the harm would not have been suffered but for the victim’s pre-existing conditions before the criminal act was inflicted</em>”. As Prosecution put it, this meant that ultimately, there must be a causative link between the accused’s acts and the injuries caused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In this case, I was satisfied that the Accused’s act of kicking Mr Philippe in his back had a causative link with the full extent of the injuries suffered by Mr Philippe, even though part of the harm would not have been suffered but for Mr Philippe’s pre-existing condition of a degenerative disc condition. Thus in sentencing, the Accused should be liable for the full extent of the injuries he had caused as a result of assaulting Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Two-step inquiry</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As a first step in applying the <em>Low Song Chye</em> framework, I considered the harm caused to Mr Philippe. He was in “debilitating pain, as the evidence showed that it was the result of his pre-existing degenerative disc disease being aggravated by the accused’s kick to his lower back”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>. Mr Philippe was given substantial medical leave as a result of his injury. He was unable to go to work and experienced extreme difficulty with routine daily tasks like walking, sleeping, getting into a car, going to the toilet. I was of the view that the harm suffered by Mr Philippe would rightly be classified as “moderate”. That would fall in Band 2 of the sentencing framework, with an indicative starting sentence of four weeks to six months’ imprisonment. Given the seriousness of the injury Mr Philippe sustained as a result of the Accused’s kick to his back, as well as the hurt caused to Mr Philippe’s head, I was of the view that an indicative starting sentence would be in the higher end of Band 2, in the range of four to six months. For that same reason of the nature of the injuries, I did not consider a Short Detention Order (SDO) to be an appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I then proceeded to the second step of the inquiry which required me to make necessary adjustments to the indicative starting sentence based on the offender’s culpability and other relevant factors. In this step of the inquiry, I took into account circumstances surrounding the assault on Mr Philippe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I agreed with the Prosecution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> that the Accused’s assault on Philippe was unprovoked and one-sided. Mr Philippe’s only intention was to ascertain where the Accused lived by going after the Accused. Apart from that, he displayed no aggression towards the Accused. In fact, he turned around to head home once he saw that the Accused had noticed him. Mr Philippe had already begun to disengage himself from any potential confrontation with the Accused. It was the Accused who went after him. The Accused struck the first blow at Mr Philippe, hitting him in the head once behind his left ear and once behind his right ear, and even taunted him to retaliate. Subsequently when Mr Philippe was trying his best to flee from the Accused after being punched on the head, he fell. Whilst Mr Philippe was on the ground, the Accused continued his assault by kicking him on his lower back. Against a much older person lying defenceless on the ground, I was of the view that the Accused’s conduct was aggravating in that situation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I was also mindful that the Accused had claimed trial to the charge. Whilst the Accused may be entitled to claim trial and to put forward his best defence to the charges, it did not entitle him to make baseless allegations against the Complainants and Dr Wong, as some allegations turned out to be. In any case, since the Accused claimed trial, no sentencing discount would be available to him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In the case of <em>Low Song Chye</em>, the offender claimed trial to a charge under section 323 of the Penal Code. In facts as summarized by the Prosecution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>, the offender was the manager of a pub of which the victim worked as a singer. The victim was unhappy with the offender over a salary dispute, and threw a tantrum in the pub. The offender then pointed at her and asked whether she believed that he would hit her. He then went towards her, grabbed her hand and pushed her towards the wall before grabbing her neck. The offender then slapped the left side of her face and ear with very great force. This caused the victim to struggle and retaliate but the offender continued to overpower the victim and swing his hand at the victim’s face, hitting her left cheek. The victim sustained a left anterior central tympanic membrane perforation that was about 50% in size, multiple scratch marks over her bilateral upper limb, minimal swelling over the dorsum of the lateral side of the right wrist, circular abrasion over right anterior knee and redness over anterior distal neck. She was given two days’ medical leave. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with mild conductive hearing loss. The offender was sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment in the District Court. On appeal, the sentence was enhanced to four months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The medical leave granted to Mr Philippe in this case was much longer. I considered the injuries suffered by Mr Philippe as a result of the Accused’s kick to his back to be more serious than what the victim in <em>Low Song Chye</em> suffered. even if their level of culpability could not be differentiated on a balance of factors. Other than the fact that the Accused was a first offender, there were no other mitigating factors. Considering the facts of the case before me, I was of the view that a sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Compensation Order</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Upon conviction, the Prosecution also urged the Court to impose a compensation order on the Accused pursuant to section 359(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.</p> <p

Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22534-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 438</a> at [6] that <em>“… s 359 imposes two obligations upon a court before which an offender is convicted of any offence: (a) to consider whether or not to make a compensation order, and (b) to make such an order if it considers it appropriate to do so.</em> On the Prosecution’s application and considering the facts of the case, I was satisfied that a compensation order was appropriate in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The invoices listed above and tendered in court mostly related to medical expenses incurred by Mr Philippe for treatment and consultation in respect of the injuries suffered by him arising from his encounter with the Accused. Save for the amounts contained in two invoices, I was prepared to order the Accused to compensate Mr Philippe for the medical expenses supported by these invoices.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The two invoices which I excluded from the computation of the compensation order related to:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_a"></a>(a)     Expenses relating to vitamins purchased (item 6 in the list above); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_b"></a>(b)     Expenses relating to a new pair of spectacles made from Spectacle Hut (item 21 in the list).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I was of the view that the purchase of vitamins could not relate directly to the injuries suffered by Mr Philippe. It was an item which may ordinarily be taken for health and general wellness; not an item of expense which may be incurred due to the hurt caused by the Accused. As for the titanium spectacles which Mr Philippe testified were “<em>stomped on</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> by the Accused and had to be replaced, I noted that the spectacles seen in photos P19-1 and P19-3 (supposedly after it had been “<em>stomped on</em>”) did not seem to show that it had been damaged such that it had to be replaced. Moreover, it was a fact that the spectacles were only replaced months later – the invoices were dated 22 October 2017 and 10 November 2017. Apart from the fact that the Accused had not been convicted on a charge of mischief, I also did not think that the expense incurred in getting a new pair of spectacles may be laid on the Accused as arising from the incident on 2 April 2017. In the circumstances, I declined to award a compensation order on those two invoices. Excluding those two items, the total compensation order made in favour of Mr Philippe was a sum of $5,470.85.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The Accused is currently on bail, pending the hearing of this appeal. A stay of execution has been granted on the serving of the sentence, payment of the fines as well as the compensation order.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 28/24-32</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 30/3-10</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 39/1-7</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 39/14-23</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 42/6-14</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 45/29-31</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 43/21-26</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 44/12-21</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 44/22-25</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 50/5-10</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>NE 23 April 2019, 51/26-52/2;
