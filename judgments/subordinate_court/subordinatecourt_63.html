single charge of mischief by fire under s 435 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“<b>Penal Code”</b>). He was seen on CCTV footage lighting up some towels at the back alley of Hotel 81 Violet (“the Hotel”), but claimed that he could not remember anything as he was intoxicated at the relevant time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The charge brought against the Accused read as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You… are charged that you, on 12 September 2017, at or about 9.50 pm, at the back area of Hotel 81 Violet at No. 97 Lavender Street (“the Hotel”), Singapore, did commit mischief by fire, to wit, you set 4 towels belonging to the Hotel on fire intending to cause wrongful loss to the Hotel, which caused wrongful loss to the Hotel amounting to S$60, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 435 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the conclusion of the Prosecution’s case, I exercised my power under s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”) to alter the charge to replace the phrase “wrongful loss to the Hotel” with “damage to the towels”. The altered charge read as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You… are charged that you, on 12 September 2017, at or about 9.50 pm, at the back area of Hotel 81 Violet at No. 97 Lavender Street (“the Hotel”), Singapore, did commit mischief by fire, to wit, you set 4 towels belonging to the Hotel on fire intending to cause damage to the towels, which caused damage amounting to S$60, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 435 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The altered charge was read to the Accused and he was called upon to enter his plea to the altered charge. He confirmed he was still claiming trial to the altered charge, and confirmed (through his defence counsel) that he was ready to proceed with the trial without recalling any of the witnesses. Defence was then called on this altered charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After hearing parties on mitigation and sentence, I imposed a term of three months’ imprisonment on the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Accused appealed against his conviction and sentence, and is currently out on a bail sum of $10,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statement of Agreed Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Many of the facts surrounding the incident on 12 September 2017 were not disputed, and a Statement of Agreed Facts was admitted into evidence accordingly. The salient portions in the Statement of Agreed Facts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> are set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 12 September 2017 at about 10.07 p.m., one Oh Shao Qi (“PW2 Oh”) called the police and reported the following: “<em>One guest burnt our linen towel because he was unhappy with us. He actually tried to sneak another friend into a 2 room hotel room. Now he left already. Please come down now</em>.” The incident location was Hotel 81 Violet at No. 97 Lavender Street (“the Hotel”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Investigations revealed that on the afternoon of 12 September 2017, the Accused and a Chua Wen Hao (“Chua”) met up and went to W KTV located at Foch Road. There, they had a few drinks and met a Vietnamese girl. The three of them then decided to head to the Hotel. Chua and the Vietnamese girl checked in at the front desk of the Hotel at about 9.19 p.m. They were given the keys to Room 301 and they entered the room at about 9.23 p.m.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At about 9.23 p.m., the Accused entered the Hotel, took the lift to level 3, and entered Room 301 shortly after 9.24 p.m. Suhailah Binte Mohamed Yusof (“PW1 Suhailah”) was a front desk staff of the Hotel who noticed from the CCTV footages that the Accused had entered Room 301, in breach of the Hotel’s policy to disallow more than two persons per room. She tried to call the room but did not manage to get through. She then went up to Room 301 at 9.34 p.m. and pressed the doorbell, as well as knocked on the door.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Chua answered the door and PW1 Suhailah told him that the room could only accommodate two people. Chua spoke to the PW1 Suhailah and closed the door. Shortly after 9.36 p.m., the Accused came out of Room 301 and asked PW1 Suhailah, who was still outside the room, if he could book a room for three people. However his request was rejected. The Accused returned to Room 301 at about 9.37 p.m., and left the room sometime after 9.38 p.m.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Accused exited the Hotel through the back door. Shortly before 9.40 p.m., he went to the rear of the Hotel, at an area where the Hotel kept crates of towels. The Accused started to smoke sometime before 9.50 p.m., and left the back area at about 9.50 p.m.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Sometime after 9.50 p.m., a passer-by saw some Hotel towels on fire at the rear area, and informed the Hotel staff. Hotel staff went to the rear area to extinguish the fire, and PW2 Oh called the police for assistance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Accused was traced via back-tracing of CCTV footages and ground enquiries. He was arrested on 21 September 2017 at about 2 p.m.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Case for the Prosecution</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Witness evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     PW1 Suhailah gave evidence that although she could not remember the details of the conversation she had with the Accused on 12 September 2017, she remembered that he looked “fine” and was “okay”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. She confirmed that he could understand what she was saying, and responding to her appropriately, though she thought him “a bit rude”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     PW2 Oh was a manager at the Hotel and confirmed that he was the one who called for the police that night, although he could not remember telling the police all the details as stated in the First Information Report (and set out at paragraph 5 of the SOAF). His evidence was that he simply told the police that his “hotel was on fire” and “please come down now”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     PW2 Oh first learnt about the towels burning when a guest who was checking out informed him. He then called the police before going to put out the fire by grabbing a bunch of towels and stamping and pouring water over them. A total of four towels were damaged with holes from the burning. According to the hotel’s internal damage chart, one damaged towel would cost $15<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. PW2 Oh had never met the Accused before or spoken to him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     PW2 Oh confirmed that he had seen the CCTV footages and he confirmed that there was no one else involved apart from the single guest he was referring to in his report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     PW3 Station Inspector Sunny Foo Shanyi (“PW3 SI Sunny”) was the first investigation officer for the case, and he arrived at the incident location on the night of 12 September 2017. He gave evidence that he had viewed the CCTV footages that day, even up to the point the staff came to put out the fire in the towels. He confirmed that there was no one else involved. He explained that it was his field squad officers who officially seized the CCTV footages, and they only seized the footages to the point when the Accused walked away.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     PW4 ASP Lee Hui Min was the investigation officer who took over the investigations sometime in June 2018. She gave evidence that in the course of the investigations, she confirmed with the Hotel that damage from the fire involved four towels and amounted to a sum of $60. The Hotel also confirmed that the Accused had made full restitution for this amount.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">CCTV footages</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     A total of eight CCTV footages were tendered into evidence. It was not disputed that the person wearing a red shirt in the footages was the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In one of the footages (Channel 14 main), the Accused was seen coming out of a hotel room at about 9.36 p.m. and conversing with PW1 Suhailah. After a short conversation, the Accused stood in the empty corridor for a few more seconds before he re-entered the hotel room. His movements seemed a bit slow, and he also appeared to fumble for a bit with the door knob before he opened the door and went in.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In another one of the footages (Channel 7 main), the Accused was seen coming out of the Hotel’s back door at about 9.39 p.m., and hanging out by the rear near a crate of towels for about 10 minutes. He spent most of the time leaning against a vending machine and seemingly scrolling through his mobile phone. Towards the end of this session (at about the 9.48:39 mark), the Accused started walking around the area, and appeared to be on the lookout for something, both around and above him. At about the 9:49:37 mark, the Accused could be seen standing very closely to the crate of towels, with his back facing the camera. A noticeable spark was seen and there was a flicking motion to the Accused’s left hand, before he turned away. He was then seen smoking a cigarette as he walked away. A small light was seen on the crate of towels after the Accused walked away. The light was in the same position as the spark which occurred when the Accused was flicking his hand earlier.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused’s statement</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     PW3 SI Sunny also recorded an investigative statement from the Accused on 21 September 2017. There was no challenge to the admissibility of this statement, and it was admitted and marked P3.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In this statement, the Accused admitted to the sequence of facts as set out in the SOAF, and also admitted that while he was smoking at the back alley, he “<em>burn the towel that was left at the alley</em>”. When asked why he had done so, the Accused said that he was “<em>probably frustrated that there wasn’t a room for 3 persons</em>”. When asked about his intentions, his answer was “<em>I just wanted to burn the towels</em>”. The Accused also explained in the same statement that he was drunk when the incident happened, and that he “<em>could not really remember what really happened</em>”. The Accused did not deny the act and said that he had “<em>no intentions to hurt anyone</em>”. He also mentioned that what he did was “<em>stupid</em>” and that he was sorry.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Close of the Prosecution’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, a submission of no case to answer was made by the Accused. The main points raised were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     The damaged towels were not seized or tendered in evidence, and as such there was no physical evidence making out the mischief charge.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused’s investigative statement had been qualified by his final answer that he was unable to recall the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was no objective evidence of the value of the damage ($60).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     There was no evidence of an intention by the Accused to cause wrongful loss or damage.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_e"></a>(e)     The charge was defective in that it referred to the <em>mens rea</em> element as an intention to cause wrongful loss, when under s 435 of the PC, the <em>mens rea</em> was an intention to cause damage to property instead.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The threshold at the end of the Prosecution’s case is a very low one. As long as there is some evidence, not inherently incredible and which satisfies each and every element of the charge, defence should be called. (See s 230(1)(j) of the CPC). Having assessed the evidence tendered at this stage, I was satisfied that this threshold had been met by the Prosecution, save for a minor alteration which was warranted to the charge. This will be elaborated on further below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With regard to the evidential points raised, I did not think that it was necessary for the damaged towels to be tendered in evidence for the Prosecution’s case to be made out. Evidence was given by PW2 Oh that he was the one who went to extinguish the fire and he confirmed that there were four towels damaged by the fire. He also confirmed that as far as the Hotel was concerned, the value of these towels was $60. The undisputed evidence was that the Accused had made restitution to the Hotel of this amount. While counsel for the Accused raised an issue regarding PW2 Oh’s credibility given his puzzling denial of the details which he apparently gave to the police when first lodging a report, I did not find that this affected his credit so much that his evidence regarding the towels and their value became inherently incredible. In any case, I noted that this was not the stage to engage in a detailed assessment of a witness’s credibility.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I also noted that at face value, the Accused’s investigative statement was clear in his admission of having burnt the towels, and having the intention to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     However, I accepted, as did the Prosecution, that counsel’s point regarding the wording in the charge was a valid one. The offence under s 435 of the PC is a offence of committing mischief by fire, “<em>intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, damage to any property</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As such, I exercised my power under s 128 of the CPC to alter the charge and replace the element of “causing wrongful loss to the Hotel” to “causing damage to the towels” instead. I took the view that the defect in the charge was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case as the offence section had been correctly set out, and the facts relied upon by the Prosecution to make out the charge was clear and did not change with the alteration. There was also no resulting prejudice to the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The amended charge was read to the Accused, who confirmed that he was still claiming trial to the altered charge. Neither the Prosecution nor the Defence applied to recall or call any further witnesses as a result of the alteration.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Having satisfied myself that the threshold under s 230(1)(j) of the CPC had been met on the altered charge, I called on the Accused to enter his defence accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Case for the Defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Accused chose to give evidence in his own defence, and also called two other witnesses.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused’s evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Accused was a naval combat officer in the Singapore Navy, with his rank at trial being that of Captain. He confirmed that he would not do anything to jeopardize his career in the Navy. He knew that there were severe penalties for getting involved in a police case, and even getting a “warning” could make him liable for discharge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     His evidence was that on 12 September 2017, he went to W KTV with his friend Chua, where they proceeded to drink about ten jugs of beer together, and listened to music. The total bill amounted to $195.38<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>, and was paid for by the Accused. The Accused’s evidence was that he could not recall what happened after they drank at W KTV, and the next thing he recalled was waking up the next day at home.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Sometime after 12 September, the Accused met Chua and they talked about the night in question. Chua asked him if he remembered what happened, and the Accused told him no. Chua then told him that the Accused went to meet him at Hotel 81. After the incident, Chua called the Accused to tell him about the fire and to ask if the Accused was the one who did it. The Accused had said no.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     With regard to the statement P3, the Accused gave evidence that prior to the recording of this statement, five police officers brought him to a small room where they told him that they knew he was the one who “did it” and told him not to lie. They also shouted at him, banged on the table, and emptied his bag, seemingly looking out for contraband cigarettes. They asked him a series of leading questions about the incident, and before they left, told him to tell the IO what he had told them. The Accused agreed and proceeded to do so accordingly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Accused admitted that he gave the statement at P3, was given an opportunity to read and make amendments, and that he had signed on the statement. According to him, the contents of the statement were almost entirely made out of information he pieced together from both Chua and the five officers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     With regard to the portion in his statement when he was asked why he burned the towel,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> the Accused’s evidence was that he initially told PW3 SI Sunny that he did not know, but PW3 SI Sunny then started raising his voice at the Accused and said that no one would believe that he did not know. So the Accused then hazarded a guess that he was “<em>probably frustrated that there wasn’t a room for 3 persons</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Accused also explained that he admitted to the offence in his statement even though he could not remember because he could not confirm based on memory whether he did it or not, and he felt that denying it when he could not remember was dishonest. The Accused did not want his “integrity” to be questioned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Accused gave evidence that sometime after the police statement was recorded, he approached Hotel 81 and enquired as to the cost of damage to the burnt towels. He was informed that it was $15 for each towel, and he made the total payment of $60 by way of apology and to make amends.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Accused tendered the cautioned statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> he gave under s 23(1) of the CPC. This statement was recorded on 15 August 2018, where the Accused stated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “<em>I do not recall much of that night and do not remember the incident. That being the case, I am truly sorry for the incident if I did it</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence from psychiatrist and psychologist</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Accused also tendered a psychiatric report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> prepared by DW3 Dr Julia Lam (“DW3 Dr Lam”) and a psychoeducational assessment report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> by DW2 Ms Karin Goh (“DW2 Ms Goh”). Both DW2 Ms Goh and DW3 Dr Lam were also called as witnesses for the defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The salient portions of the psychiatric report by DW3 Dr Lam are set out below:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused displayed the following symptoms of an Asperger Syndrome:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_46-p2_i-p3_i"></a>(i)       Qualitative impairment in social interaction;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_46-p2_i-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_46-p2_i-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Qualitative impairments in verbal and non-verbal communication and</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_46-p2_i-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Impairments in imagination</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     Based on the self-reported amount of alcohol consumed by the Accused, he would have been heavily intoxicated and could be in an alcoholic blackout at the material time. The blood alcohol content would be in the range of 200-280 mg/100ml. A normal person with such a level would have major impairment of mental and physical control, slurred speech and in need of medical evaluation and assistance. He or she is also likely to have been in a state of mental confusion and can misinterpret events and threats at this alcohol level. A person is also usually amnestic for events till the alcohol level drops, and he or she also will have difficulty forming coherent thoughts or intent. However, the person can sometimes still move about talk, and even appear purposeful.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     The findings indicate that the accused might suffer from an Asperger’s Syndrome i.e. Autism Spectrum Disorder. If so, then psychological literature suggested that such individuals may be more vulnerable in an interrogative interview where they may be eager to avoid conflict or confrontation and may respond compliantly to the requests or suggestions of others, despite not necessarily agreeing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the psychoeducational assessment report, DW2 Ms Goh found that the Accused met the DSM-5 criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1 (requiring support) without intellectual impairment. She wrote that “[t]hese symptoms have caused clinically significant impairment in social, academic and occupational functioning.”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Did the Accused set fire to the towels?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It seemed clear to me from the evidence that he did.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The most important piece of evidence on this point was the CCTV footage (Channel 7 main), which showed that the Accused had stood very near the crate of towels, and that he had lighted up something, which caused a spark and what appeared to be a small flame to appear and remain on the crate of towels.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It was a pity that the rest of the footage was not recovered and tendered in court, to confirm that the little light eventually grew into the small fire which damaged the towels. PW3 SI Sunny’s explanation for this was that he did not seize the subsequent footage as it did not involve anyone else.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In any case, I found the idea that someone else might have happened to arrive in that short span of time and lit up the same spot for no apparent reason to be too fanciful and hypothetical.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Furthermore, I noted that PW3 SI Sunny confirmed in court that he had watched the footage to the point when the staff came to put out the fire, and that no one else was involved. PW2 Oh also confirmed that when he viewed the footage, no one else was involved apart from the single guest he referred to in his police report. I had no reason to disbelieve this evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The conclusion I drew was therefore that the fire had started because of the Accused’s actions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In his closing submissions, the Accused highlighted that a time period of almost 20 minutes appeared to have elapsed from the time the Accused was captured on CCTV leaving the scene (about 9.50 p.m.), to the time the police report was first lodged (about 10.07 p.m.). I agreed that this time period appeared to be a bit long, although still not implausible. I also noted that although it was PW2 Oh’s evidence that he had called the police before going to put out the fire, I found this improbable given that in his police report, he had informed the police about the guest he had seen from the CCTV footages. It was unlikely that PW2 Oh would have known that there was a fire burning near the hotel, and still perused the CCTV footages first before putting it out. Therefore, I found the more likely scenario to be one where PW2 Oh had gone to put out the fire first and viewed the CCTV footages, before calling the police. This would explain the gap in time. In the face of the CCTV evidence capturing the Accused’s actions, and PW3 SI Sunny and PW2 Oh’s evidence regarding what they had seen on the CCTV footage up to the point of the towels burning, I maintained my view that the idea of someone else subsequently coming up to light up the same spot was too fanciful to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. I found that it was the Accused who had set fire to the towels.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I also accepted that the fire had caused damage to four towels, and that the cost of this to the Hotel amounted to a sum of $60. As I stated at [29] above, I did not think it necessary that the damaged towels themselves had to be brought to court and objectively determined to have had a value of $60, before the charge could be made out.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The evidence that the damage consisted of four towels valued at a sum of $60, came from PW2 Oh and PW4 ASP Lee’s evidence of her correspondence with the hotel’s general manager to confirm the damage<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     There was an issue raised at trial regarding PW2 Oh’s credibility, as he had claimed in evidence that he did not give the details as reflected in the FIR. I agreed that this part of his evidence was a bit strange, but I note this incident took place three years ago, and it was not implausible that his memory of what he actually told the police had faded. I accepted that those words as set out in the FIR must have come from him, and therefore his evidence in court must have been inaccurate on this point. However, I did not think that this alone necessarily detracted from his evidence regarding the four towels and $60. As a manager at a Hotel 81 branch (both at the material time and during the trial), PW2 Oh was certainly in a position to give evidence on the value of these towels, and I could see no reason why he would lie about the number of towels damaged. In addition, I note that his evidence was also corroborated by PW4 ASP Lee’s investigations as well as the undisputed sum of $60 restitution made by the Accused. Restitution had been made soon after the incident, and would presumably have been based on the contemporaneous finding by the Hotel with regard to how many towels had been damaged. There was therefore little possibility that PW2 Oh could have been mistaken about the number of towels burnt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I did not think that a criminal trial was the place to argue over the exact valuation of the towel and whether the Hotel was over-profitting by putting a value of $15 on each towel. The evidence showed that as far as the Hotel was concerned, it incurred a loss of $15 for each towel it lost. That was sufficient.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I therefore found that the Accused had set fire to the towels, and caused damage to four of them, with a total value of $60.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Did he set fire to the towels intentionally?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The next and more pertinent question was whether the Accused had set fire to the towels, <em>intending</em> to cause damage to them. Having assessed the evidence, I was satisfied that he did.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Accused’s defence was that he was so intoxicated that he did not remember the incident, and could not have formed any intention in relation to his actions at that material time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Prosecution’s main evidence on this point comes from the Accused’s admission in his investigative statement, as well as the CCTV footages.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The contents of the the Accused’s statement came from him</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I did not accept the objections raised by the Defence regarding the Accused’s investigative statement, and accepted that the statement was voluntarily given and accurately recorded, and that the contents were provided solely by the Accused himself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Accused’s bare assertions that there were five other police officers who had interrogated him prior to the interview, shouting and banging on tables and providing him with the contents of the statement, before disappearing into thin air, was difficult to believe. I could see no possible motive for five police officers acting this way, unless they were colluding with the statement recorder to set up a positive statement. Yet this was not the case put forth by the Defence, and this was certainly never put to PW3 SI Sunny when he was on the stand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Furthermore, it was the Accused’s evidence that his initial answer to the question of “<em>Why did you burn the towel?</em>” (as reflected in Q1 of the statement) was “<em>I don’t know</em>.” However, this answer was not accepted by PW3 SI Sunny, who then “started raising his voice” and saying that no one would believe him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> This was also never put to PW3 SI Sunny.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In any case, I found it hard to accept that this had indeed taken place, bearing in mind that in the last answer of the statement, PW3 SI Sunny had recorded (apparently accurately) that the Accused was drunk when the incident happened and could not really remember what happened. PW3 SI Sunny also accepted in cross examination that it was possible that the Accused could not “remember fully”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Based on these, I took the view that this was unlikely to be a witness who would raise his voice and refuse to accept an answer of “<em>I don’t know</em>” during the statement recording process.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I therefore rejected these assertions made by the Accused with regard to the statement recording process, and found that the contents found in the statement had been provided by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the statement, the Accused admitted that he had burnt the towels, and that he did it because he was “<em>probably frustrated that there wasn’t a room for 3 persons</em>.” When asked what his intention was, his answer was “<em>I just wanted to burn the towels.</em>”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     For completeness, I did not think that the final answer in the statement that he “<em>could not really remember what really happened</em>” qualified his admissions, as he did confirm that he was not denying the act and that he had no intentions to hurt anyone. It was perfectly reasonable to expect that the Accused would not have been able to remember every detail of the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Accused’s psychiatric condition did not detract from the accuracy of his investigative statement</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Accused relied on DW3 Dr Lam’s report to argue that as a person suffering from Asperger’s Syndrome i.e. Autism Spectrum Disorder (“ASD”), he was more vulnerable in an interrogative interview, and would have responded compliantly to the requests or suggestions of others despite not necessarily agreeing. This was the reason why a “false confession” had been recorded in P6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As set out above, I rejected his factual assertions regarding what had taken place during the statement recording process. I did not find that any officers had interrogated him in a coercive manner, or refused to accept an answer of “<em>I don’t know</em>.” Therefore, even if I accepted that the Accused suffered from some form of ASD, there was no basis to find that this had impacted the statement recording or the contents of the statement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I also found PW3 Dr Lam’s report unhelpful in this aspect because the possibility of a false confession was framed generally and as an academic possibility – psychological literature suggested that individuals with ASD might be more vulnerable in an interrogative interview. The report did not delve into <em>how</em> the false confession was elicited in this case, and in particular how and why the answers came out the way they did. The report merely stated that the Accused had been repeatedly told “<em>No one will believe you</em>”, which induced “self-doubt” in himself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Ultimately, I did not find that anyone had told the Accused that no one would believe him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The Accused’s explanation that he had so readily admitted to something he had no recollection of was also difficult to accept. According to him, he felt that denying it outright would be “dishonest” as he did not know whether he had done it, and as an officer, he did not want to have his “integrity” questioned. This was difficult to reconcile with the Accused’s evidence that he would not do anything to jeopardize his career, and his awareness that even a warning for a police case would make him liable for a discharge. In these circumstances, I failed to see why he would so readily admit to a serious offence such as mischief by fire, if in truth he could not remember doing so. The simple response which someone in his position would have given was “I don’t know” or “I don’t remember”. That would have been the more honest answer, and one which certainly would not have impacted on his integrity. I therefore rejected his explanation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     All in, I did not find that the Accused’s explanations or attempts to discredit the contents of the investigative statement believable or credible.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">No basis to find that the Accused was labouring under an “alcoholic blackout”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     PW3 Dr Lam was of the opinion that the Accused could have been in an “alcoholic blackout” at the material time. Her bases for saying this were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused’s self reported amount of alcohol consumed on the night in question would have put his blood alcohol content in the range of 200 – 280mg/100ml.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused reported that he had no recollections of the events in question.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_c"></a>(c)     A perusal of the CCTV footage showed that the Accused appeared dazed and was slow in his motion ad he missed the hotel room door knob a few times before he managed to open the door.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The problem with the first two bases above was that it was entirely self reported, and therefore self serving. In the first place, the actual amount of alcohol the Accused drank could not be determined, even from the Accused’s own memory. No one goes about remembering exactly how much they had to drink and what the alcohol content of their specific drinks were. Furthermore, the Accused, on his own evidence, did not recall much of the events that day.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Given that the Accused’s blood alcohol level at the material time was not tested, any attempts to put a figure to it could only be speculation. In any case, it is general knowledge that every individual metabolises alcohol at a different rate, and also reacts differently to different levels of alcohol. I found that the evidence regarding the Accused’s alcohol intake at the material time was too uncertain to be relied on. Therefore, all the conclusions that flowed from this estimated alcohol level were also speculative.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Importantly, PW3 Dr Lam’s general description of mental and physical control impairment in an individual with a blood alcohol level of 200 – 280 mg/100ml was not borne out by the CCTV footages and the evidence from PW1 Suhailah. PW3 Dr Lam relied on only a very small aspect of the footage to form her opinion that the Accused was heavily intoxicated.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     However, it could be seen from the rest of the CCTV footages that the Accused had no difficulty moving around and was purposeful in his actions. In particular, he could press a lift button, move aside for someone to exit the lift before entering, and find the correct hotel room by himself. The footages also showed him appearing to have a normal conversation with PW1 Suhailah. This was confirmed by PW1 Suhailah in court, when she gave evidence that the Accused appeared fine and was able to respond to her when she was talking to him. In cross examination, the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) also established that the Accused had likely walked all the way from W KTV to Hotel 81 himself, which would certainly require a sense of navigation at least.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     While there was footage to show that the Accused had missed the door knob a few times, and had been a bit slow in reacting after his conversation with PW1 Suhailah, this would show that he was intoxicated or tired, but certainly not that he was so heavily intoxicated that he could not have formed the intention to do anything. This was especially so after taking into consideration the rest of the footages.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Therefore, there was no objective evidence of the Accused’s level of intoxication at the relevant time, and the surrounding facts did not show that the Accused was so intoxicated that he could not form the intention to damage the towels.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In court, PW3 Dr Lam based all her answers on her assumption that the Accused was heavily intoxicated and in an “alcoholic blackout.” All his actions were seen by her in this context, and therefore she took pains to explain that even a heavily intoxicated person could behave in the way the Accused did.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     However, it does not take a trained psychatrist to know that a normal person could also have behaved in the way the Accused did. This evidence that a person in an alcoholic blackout <em>could</em> have acted the way the Accused did is therefore neither here nor there.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I accepted that the Accused was probably intoxicated at the relevant time. I accepted that he drank alcohol before the incident, and his motion of missing the door knob also indicated that he was perhaps slower than usual in processing his environment. However, this did not necessarily equate to an “alcoholic blackout”. His other actions that day indicated that he was quite aware of his surroundings and could respond to it. He could find his way to the hotel room and could have a normal conversation with the hotel staff. I did not accept he was so drunk that he could not have formed intentions to his actions that day. I noted that even DW3 Dr Lam appeared to agree that at that point, the Accused would have known what he was doing. Her point was more that he forgot about it afterwards.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Against this backdrop, I was of the view that the <em>possibility</em> of an alcoholic blackout based on <em>speculative</em> blood alcohol level did not raise a reasonable doubt as to the purposefulness of the Accused’s actions at the material time. The Accused was fully capable of forming an intention to damage the towels.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As to whether he had done so with that intention, I was satisfied that the CCTV footage (Channel 14 main) as well as his admission in P6 showed that he did.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     From the Channel 14 main footage from 9.39 p.m. to about 9.50 p.m., it could be seen that the Accused’s actions were deliberate and controlled. He was not acting like he had difficulty moving. Tellingly, he was looking around prior to doing the act, even observing upwards. He seemed to be on the lookout for anyone or any camera which might catch him in the act, before he went ahead to do it. All of this pointed to a man who knew what he was doing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In his investigative statement, the Accused also admitted that he “just wanted to burn the towels”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Based on all of the above, I found that the Accused had intended to cause damage to the towels by burning them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I therefore found that the Prosecution had proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted the Accused accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Accused was untraced.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submission on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The Prosecution sought a sentence in the range of three to four months’ imprisonment. Apart from citing the need for general deterrence, the Prosecution also relied on the following points:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     The potential harm which could be caused was great. While the actual damage caused in the present case was limited, this was purely fortuitous and the result of a passer-by seeing the fire and alerting the hotel staff early enough.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was premeditation involved. This could be seen from the fact that the Accused had been in the Hotel’s back area for about 10 minutes before he walked around, checking for surveillance cameras before committing the criminal act. After he committed the act, he walked away and did not turn back, showing a lack of regard for the potential harm his actions could cause.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Accused had committed the act as an act of revenge against the Hotel. The circumstances showed that the Accused had made plans to be in the hotel room, but was eventually chased away after a lengthy discussion with PW1 Suhailah. By his own admission in his police statement, he has also burned the towels as he was frustrated that there was no room for three persons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     A table of sentencing precedents was tendered by the Prosecution, showing imprisonment sentences ranging from three months to five months being imposed for offences under s 435 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”) involving offenders who were either untraced, or traced with unrelated antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The Accused asked for one day imprisonment, on the basis of the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused came from a good personal background, with a distinguished career in the Singapore Navy. Following his conviction, he was suspended from his job without pay, and this had devastated him. The consequences of losing his job was already dire.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused was of good character, as could be seen from the numerous character references provided by his colleagues and superiors. In particular, he was described as being “responsible”, “professional”, “trustworthy” and “reliable”.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Accused had expressed remorse for his actions even though he could not recall the incident. This could be seen from his statement to the police, as well as his prompt actions in making restitution and apologising to the Hotel.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Accused had since taken steps to reduce his alcohol intake, to ensure that a similar situation would not arise in the future.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_e"></a>(e)     Given his clean background, the Accused had no propensity to re-offend.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Accused’s culpability was low and the damage caused minimal.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_g"></a>(g)     The Accused had cooperated with the police, and was untraced.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The Accused rejected the submission by the Prosecution that he had committed the offence out of revenge or that there was premeditation, citing a lack of evidence in this regard.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Court’s decision on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Any case involving the offence of mischief by fire has to be taken seriously, given the potential harm involved. This stems from the simple but incontrovertible premise that fire is not controllable. If one chooses to start a fire, he/she takes the risk that the end result could end up becoming quite disastrous. This is also the reason why there is a strong need for deterrence for such offences, both general and specific.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Therefore, while I accepted that the actual harm caused in the present case was minimal ($60) and that this was a relevant factor to be taken into consideration in sentencing, I was wary of attributing too much weight on it. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was purely fortuitous that the fire was detected early and not allowed to spread further. The more pertinent point was that the Accused had set fire to a pile of flammable materials, near the entrance/exit of a Hotel, and then walked away without caring what happened next. There was great potential harm involved, and this had to be taken into consideration when sentencing him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In terms of motive, I accepted that based on the evidence, there was some element of revenge on the part of the Accused. By his admission, he had been frustrated with the Hotel and given the background circumstances which led to him having to hover near the back area instead of being in the hotel room with Chua and the Vietnamese lady, the irresistible inference to be drawn was that he had set fire to the hotel towels to express this frustration and as a way to get back at the Hotel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     However, I was not entirely convinced that his actions had been premeditated to the extent that it was an aggravating factor which ought to affect the sentence. The fact that he had hovered in the back area for about 10 minutes did not necessarily mean that he had been ruminating over his plan to set the towels on fire for the whole time he was there. It was equally plausible that he had formed his intentions shortly before he actually committed the criminal act. The benefit of the doubt should be given to the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    With regard to the points raised pertaining to the Accused’s good character and clean background, I accepted them as relevant only in so far as they indicated that the Accused was unlikely to re-offend again.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I considered some of the precedents cited, which generally showed a sentencing range from three months onwards for offences under s 435 PC:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>PP v Malisah Binte Mohammad Said</em> (SC 906229/20193), the offender was in her bedroom and flicked a cigarette butt which landed on the mattress of a bed. She saw that the lit cigarette was starting to burn the mattress and knew that it was likely to cause a fire to break out. However, she ignored it as she was angry with her husband for wanting to divorce her and wanted to get back at him. She left the premises shortly. As a result of her actions, a fire broke out in the unit and residents from 20 other neighbouring units had to evacuate from their homes. The damage to the unit was $16,820. The offender was untraced and sentenced to a term of five months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>PP v Abdul Rahman Bin Ismail</em> (SC 907247/2018), the offender was angry with the town council after having lost his job as a cleaner. He set fire at a void deck using a lighter to some discarded items. Another similar charge was taken into consideration. The total damage for both charges amounted to $850. The offender was traced with unrelated antecedents, and sentenced to a term of four months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>PP v Rahimah Binte Abdol Rahim</em> (SC 900421/2015), the offender was angry with her parents-in-law and set fire to some newspapers at the corner of the living room of the flat where she resided with them. The fire became uncontrollable even though the offender and some family members later tried to put it out. The flat was evacuated, and the damage amounted to $6,800. The offender was untraced and sentenced to a term of four months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_d"></a>(d)     In <em>PP v Soon Yani @ Soon Yi Xuan</em> (SC 905033/2016), the offender was frustrated with her mother for having given her too little money and set fire to her mother’s clothes with a lighter. She later panicked when the fire spread and ran away. The damage caused amount to about $10,000. The offender was traced with unrelated antecedents and sentenced to a term of three months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_e"></a>(e)     In <em>PP v Lee Jun Xiang</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18864-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGDC 120</a>, the offender pleaded guilty to three charges under s 435 PC, and one charge under s 336(a) PC. He had set fire to rubbish chutes at his condominium block using lighter and newspapers on five occasions, causing damages to the amount of $7,200. The offender was untraced and sentenced to a term of four months’ imprisonment for each of the charges under s 435, with a total of 8 months’ imprisonment. His appeal was withdrawn.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_f"></a>(f)     In <em>PP v Tan Yan Chong</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25141-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 239</a>, the offender faced multiple charges, including one charge under s 435 PC. The offender used duct tape to seal the edges of the victim’s front door before using a lighted roll of paper to brush against the door, causing burnt marks. The offence had been committed when he was on court bail, and a third occasion in which he had targetted the victim. The offender was untraced and sentenced to a term of four months’ imprisonment for the charge under s 435 PC. His appeal lapsed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_g"></a>(g)     In <em>PP v Thiruvengadam Varadharajan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25587-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 25</a>, the offender set fire to a white cloth which was placed between the visor and meter of a motorcycle, causing damage amounting to $88. The offender was untraced and sentenced to a term of five months imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    An outlier appeared to be the case of <em>Teo Sew Eng v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 3 SLR(R) 0324.xml')">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 324</a> (“<em>Teo Sew Eng</em>”), where the offender had abetted her son to set the victim’s vehicle on fire by providing him with implements and materials. The damage caused amounted to $40,500. On appeal, her imprisonment term of six months’ was reduced to two months. In coming to this decision, the High Court had considered the fact that the main perpetrators had been sentenced to probation, and that this incident had arisen out of a family spat.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    I should also highlight that the precedent cases cited above all involved offenders who had pleaded guilty.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    I did not find the facts of the present case to be exceptional in any way, whether for or against the Accused. The Accused had acted out of revenge and a careless disregard for the property rights and safety of others. The offence had been committed in an area where one would expect there to be some human traffic, and in particular near a hotel where there would be greater potential for danger to human safety. On the other hand, the damage caused was minimal and restitution had been made. Given the Accused’s background, I was also satisfied that he was unlikely to re-offend. Nevertheless, the need for general deterrence for such offences was still strong, and the Defence’s proposal of one day imprisonment was clearly incompatible with both the precedents as well as this sentencing principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In the circumstances, I took the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment, at the lower end of the range as demonstrated by the precedents, would be sufficient and appropriate deterrent.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    For completeness, I should state that I did not think the case of <em>Teo Sew Eng</em> was directly applicable to the present case, as the factual scenario and the role of the offender was different, and the sentencing factors cited by the High Court were not present.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Given the evidence from the CCTV footages, Prosecution witnesses as well as the Accused’s investigative statement, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had set fire to the towels in the back area of the Hotel, knowing that he would cause damage to the said towels.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Given the minimal damage caused, the Accused’s clean background and the restitution made, I was of the view that some leniency could be exercised in terms of the sentence. However, given the need for general deterrence for such offences, as well as the fact that the Accused had committed this offence as an act of revenge and in an area with great potential harm to both property and human safety, it would be entirely inappropriate to impose a nominal term of one day imprisonment as suggested by the Defence. There was no reason why this case should be treated exceptionally, and a sentence in line with the sentencing precedents would be appropriate. In the circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was entirely appropriate and justified, and imposed the same accordingly.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Admitted and marked PS1.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence (“NE”), 2 July 2020 at page 12 line 18.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>See NE, 2 July 2020 at page 27 line 3.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>See NE, 2 July 2020 at page 40 lines 15 – 16.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>See NE, 2 July 2020 at page 44 line 12.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>See NE, 2 July 2020 at page 37 lines 17 – 23.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>See NE, 2 July 2020 at pages 56 – 57.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>See NE, 3 July 2020 at page 9, lines 1 – 8.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>See NE, 9 December 2020 at page 5 lines 3 – 10.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>See credit card statement admitted and marked D5.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>See NE, 9 December 2020 at pages 10 – 12.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>See Q1 and A1 in P3.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_13_1" id="Ftn_13">[note: 13]</a></sup>See NE, 9 December 2020 at page 17 lines 4 – 11.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_14_1" id="Ftn_14">[note: 14]</a></sup>See NE, 9 Decembe 2020 at page 18 lines 15 – 21.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_15_1" id="Ftn_15">[note: 15]</a></sup>Admitted and marked D2.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_16_1" id="Ftn_16">[note: 16]</a></sup>Admitted and marked D1.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_17_1" id="Ftn_17">[note: 17]</a></sup>Admitted and marked D6.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_18_1" id="Ftn_18">[note: 18]</a></sup>See NE, 2 July 2020 at page 57 line 27.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_19_1" id="Ftn_19">[note: 19]</a></sup>See NE, 3 July 2020 at page 9 lines 1 – 8.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_20_1" id="Ftn_20">[note: 20]</a></sup>See NE, 9 December 2020 at page 17 lines 4 – 7.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_21_1" id="Ftn_21">[note: 21]</a></sup>See NE, 2 July 2020 at page 76 lines 21 – 24.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_22_1" id="Ftn_22">[note: 22]</a></sup>See <em>Tan Chor Jin v PP</em> [2018] 4 SLR (R) 306 at [27].</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_23_1" id="Ftn_23">[note: 23]</a></sup>See NE 11 December 2020 at page 83 lines 19 – 21;
