International Placements (S) Pte Ltd (“IPS”), entered into a management agreement with a Singapore company, DD Pte Ltd (“DDPL”). DDPL was a retailer operating a chain of discount stores. Under this agreement, IPS earned management fees by arranging for nine foreign students to join DDPL’s on-the-job training (“OJT”) programme. It did so by sourcing for the trainees, collecting and forwarding their biodata to DDPL, arranging interviews between DDPL and the trainees, assisting in the preparation of the trainees’ Training Work Pass applications, which were submitted by DDPL to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), managing the details of the trainees’ stay in Singapore (including their accommodation, upkeep and medical treatment) and facilitating their return to their home countries. The trainees were not under any contract of service with DDPL. During the OJT programme, they worked at DDPL’s stores, performing retail, management and stocking duties. IPS was charged with carrying on an employment agency without a licence in breach of s 6(1) of the EAA and was fined $40,000 upon conviction. It appealed against the conviction on the grounds that it did not carry on an employment agency because it did not perform work in connection with the employment of persons, which, narrowly defined, required a contract of service between the employer and employee. The High Court held as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     An employment agency would be characterised by the work it did in connection with the employment of persons, especially the four categories of specified employment work as defined within section 2 of the EAA. As the EAA did not define “employment”, its meaning would be ascertained in accordance with established principles of statutory interpretation: at [17] to [19].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The term “employment” could bear a broad or technical meaning. The technical or narrow definition of employment referred to a legal relationship in the sense of employment pursuant to a contract of service. The broad meaning of employment referred to an engagement or use to do something whether or not there was a contract of service: at [23].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     “Employment” as used in the EAA likely bore the broad meaning for three reasons. Firstly, the third limb of section 2 of the EAA expressly referred to, and was to be interpreted broadly in order to accommodate, the broad definition of “employment” within the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A,2009 Rev Ed). Secondly, given that an employment agency was an entity carried on for or in connection with the employment of persons in any capacity, a broad meaning of employment was required to encompass the work specified in section 2 of the EAA done in relation to the employment of such persons. Thirdly, records of Parliamentary proceedings showed that from its inception, Parliament had always intended the EAA to protect workers in Singapore from exploitation by unethical employment agencies and a broad meaning of employment was necessary for the EAA to serve this intended protective purpose: at [25] to [29], [32] and [42].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     IPS’ reliance on the Employment Agencies Licence Conditions (“EALC”), which contained a narrow definition of employment and expressly stated that it did not cover the emplacement of foreigners in training, was misplaced. Firstly, the EALC could not elucidate what the legislative purpose of the EAA was because it only reflected what the Commissioner intended to cover by the imposition of those conditions, not what Parliament intended with regard to the entire EAA. Secondly, the fact that the EALC did not permit the emplacement of foreigners in training by licensed employment agencies did not mean that such activities could be performed by unlicensed entities. Both licensed and unlicensed entities were equally prohibited from carrying out such activities: at [44] to [46].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_e"></a>(e)     The narrow definition of employment adopted in the Employment Act (Cap 91, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EA”) and the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed)(WICA) did not mean that Parliament intended the EAA to carry the same definition, given that the EAA did not refer to either of those statutes and the legislative objectives of the EA and WICA, which regulated the employer-employee relationship, were clearly distinguishable from those of the EAA, which regulated the work done by employment agencies. The fresh evidence that IPS sought to admit by way of the Criminal Motion related to the narrow interpretation of employment in the WICA and was therefore irrelevant. The Criminal Motion therefore failed: at [47] to [50].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_f"></a>(f)     The trial judge was right in finding that the trainees were in the employment of DDPL. By collating and forwarding the trainees’ biodata for the purpose of helping them establish an employer-employee relationship with DDPL, IPS had performed work falling within the second limb of “specified employment agency work” within section 2 of the EAA. The other aspects of the work IPS did also facilitated the placement of the trainees with DDPL for work. This fell within the fourth limb of “specified employment agency work” within section 2 of the EAA. As it had invoiced DDPL on a monthly basis for such work, it had carried on an unlicensed employment agency in breach of section 6(1) of the EAA: at [52] and [53].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_g"></a>(g)     The sentence imposed on IPS was not manifestly excessive. The sentencing judge had correctly taken the various sentencing factors into account. The lack of harm caused by IPS’ actions did not mean that IPS was any less culpable for the offence. Harm referred to the measure of injury which had been caused to society by the commission of the offence, while culpability measured the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions, chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act. The sentencing judge was right in finding that, while IPS had caused a low degree of harm, its culpability fell within the medium range, given the number of trainees emplaced and the quantum of fees collected. IPS’ appeal against sentence therefore failed: at [66] to [71], [74] and [75].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">COURT’S DECISIONS ON THE LEGAL ISSUES</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Having carefully considered the submissions of both parties, my decisions on the legal issues arising in the present case are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issue (a)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I agreed with the prosecution that having regard to the High Court decision in the <em>IPS case</em>, the 2 charges preferred against the AP (in DAC 935609/2019 and DAC 935610/2019) under section 6(4) read with section 6(2) of the EAA and punishable under section 6(4)(a) of the same Act for his role in facilitating the emplacement of TEP holders from schools in India with various companies in Singapore are valid for the reasons given by the prosecution as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defence argument that as Condition 1<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> of the Employment Agencies Licensing Condition (EALC) for Comprehensive Licence expressly excludes placing a foreigner in a training programme, or obtaining a training employment pass or a training work permit for the foreigner, it would therefore be permissible to carry out such emplacement without a license has been raised in the <em>IPS case</em> where the High Court had rejected the argument and explained as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       While the Commissioner may specify the type of employment agency activities that may not be undertaken by licensed employment agencies, it does not however mean that such activities may then be performed by unlicensed entities<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       It is common sense that harmful employment activities will not be sanctioned under the licence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       It is only logical that if licensed employment agencies cannot carry out the activities (as stated under Condition 1), unlicensed employment agencies are “equally prohibited” from carrying out such activities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The legislative purposes of the EAA are to enforce standards of practice in respect of all employment-agency related work and protect workers (both local and foreign) from unlicensed and unethical employment agency practices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       Allowing unlicensed employment agencies to carry out activities in connection with placing foreigners in training programme and obtaining work passes for the foreigners would inadvertently undermine the legislative purpose of the EAA as these activities would not have been regulated and foreigners who used the services of these unlicensed employment agencies to obtain training work passes or to be placed in a training programme would also not be protected from unethical employment agency practices.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_a-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       The policy intent of MOM behind Condition 1 is that employers should perform activities in connection with placing foreigners in training programme and obtaining work passes for the foreigners and liaise directly with the schools as well as the students on the scope of the training programme.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_a-p3_vii"></a>(vii)       It would first be illogical and contrary to the MOM policy intent to disallow licensed employment agencies to carry out activities in connection with placing foreigners in training programme and obtaining work passes for the foreigners while allowing unlicensed employment agencies to carry out such activities.

In the <em>IPS case</em>, the High Court also held<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> that the said conditions were made by the Commissioner instead of Parliament.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I agreed with the prosecution that the High Court decision in <em>the IPS case</em> was not given <em>per incuriam</em> for the reasons given by the prosecution as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The crux of the defence submissions is that the EALC reflects parliamentary intent as it was promulgated after parliamentary debate.

In paragraph 3 of the ASOF, the AP had admitted that he had performed activities in connection with the employment of persons within Singapore on his own behalf without a valid licence and facilitated the placement of TEP holders from schools in India with various companies in Singapore. Paragraphs 5 to 6 of the ASOF provided a detailed description of the activities carried out by the AP in connection with employment by placing the various TEP holders with the various companies in Singapore. A list of the successful placements of the TEP holders with the various companies are indicated in the table at paragraph 7 of the ASOF. The AP also admitted in paragraphs 8 to 9 of the ASOF that he had emplaced about 30 TEP holders in total and for the said periods of arranging for the placement of about 30 TEP holders, he had in total earned between $6,000 to $30,000 from the said schools in India.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I have carefully considered and see no merit in the defence submissions on the legal issues posed to the parties at the trial for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The principle in <em>Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All ER 560</em> (the <em>Carltona</em> principle) which was relied upon by the defence (in its submissions on the interpretation of the powers of the Commissioner and the Minister under the EAA) had been applied by the High Court in <em>Re Asia Development Pte Ltd <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23432-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 181</a></em> where it was held (at [13]) that a reference to powers conferred on a Minister (under s 74(1) of the Stamp Duties Act (Cap 312, 2006 Rev Ed)) may be exercised by officials in the ministry of that Minister.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Asia Development Pte Ltd v AG <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24299-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGCA 22</a></em> which held at [9] as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       As a general rule, Ministers cannot be expected to exercise each of their functions in person. This does not mean to say that there are <em>no</em> functions that must be exercised by a Minister in person. Rather, whether the <em>Carltona</em> principle applies to allow powers conferred on a Minister to be exercised by his or her officers would depend on <b>a contextual inquiry that considers the nature, scope and purpose of the function vested in the Minister, and the relevant language of the statute and of the specific provision in question</b>. In particular, the court will have regard to whether the statutory language has the effect of excluding any devolution or delegation, as the case may be. (emphasis mine)</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the Minister is responsible for the decisions of his or her officers acting under his or her authority. The Minister is answerable to Parliament for those decisions. It follows that it is generally a matter for Ministers, who are responsible to Parliament, to ensure that the duties and functions in question are carried out by duly experienced and qualified officers.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Following the approach enunciated by the Court of Appeal and based on a contextual inquiry that considers the nature, scope and purpose of the function vested respectively in the Commissioner and Minister under the EAA and the relevant language of the EAA and of the specific provisions in the EAA, I rejected the defence submissions and took the view that the <em>Carltona</em> principle is inapplicable to the present case because :</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       Section 7 of the EAA specifically confers on the Commissioner the power to grant, renew or refuse an application for a licence with or without conditions, and he may vary or revoke any existing conditions at any time. Section 27(2) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed)(“IA”) states that where a written law confers a power or imposes a duty on the holder of an office as such, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be performed by the holder of the office for the time being or by a person duly appointed to act for him.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       It is clear from section 7 of the EAA read with section 27(2) of the IA that the act of the Commissioner in dealing with a licence application and imposing, varying or revoking any licence conditions is done in the exercise of his power under section 7 of the EAA and he alone (or a person duly appointed to act for him) can exercise the power and perform the duty under section 7 of the EAA.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The aforesaid act of the Commissioner is not the act of a government department official in MOM synonymous with the act of the Minister in charge of MOM as the power of the Minister to make rules under section 29(1)(a) of the EAA to prescribe the types of employment in respect of which licences may be granted cannot take away the specific power conferred on the Commissioner under section 7 of the EAA and confer it on the Minister.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The aforesaid view is reinforced by section 13 of the EAA which allows any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Commissioner made under section 7 of the EAA to appeal to the Minister whose decision shall be final, and the Minister may, by writing under his hand, delegate all or any of his powers under section 13 (except this power of delegation) to any public officer, but any such delegation is revocable at will and no delegation shall prevent the exercise of any power under section 13 by the Minister and a power so delegated, when exercised by the delegate, shall for the purposes of section 13 be deemed to have been exercised by the Minister.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     In this regard, I agreed with the prosecution submissions that:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       It is important to distinguish the present case from <em>Re Asia Development Pte Ltd</em> which pertains to section 74(1) read with section 74(2B) of the Stamps Duties Act<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> (Cap 312, 2006 Rev Ed) conferring discretionary power on the Minister for Finance, whereas the present case involves section 7(3) of the EAA which is a provision empowering the Commissioner to deal with a licence application and impose, vary or revoke any licence conditions.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The <em>Carltona</em> principle does not assist the Court on the issue of statutory interpretation of section 7(3)of the EAA and does not support the proposition that legislative purpose of an Act can be ascertained from the decisions made by officers acting under a Minister's authority.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       It is also instructive that the Court of Appeal in <em>Asia Development Pte Ltd v AG</em> did not draw any proposition from the <em>Carltona</em> case that parliamentary intent can be gleaned by applying the <em>Carltona</em> principle.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     As the <em>Carltona</em> principle is inapplicable to the present case as explained in (b) above, the defence contention that placement by the AP of TEP holders from India with various companies in Singapore are permitted on the ground that such placement was excluded from the EALC (which expressly states that it did not cover the emplacement of foreigners in training) is contrary to the High Court decision in the <em>IPS case</em> and is clearly untenable.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     While I note that the defence in its submissions had agreed with the reasoning and decision of the High Court in the <em>IPS case</em> on the meaning of “employment” and “employer” in the EAA, I see no merit in the defence caveat that the acts of the AP, in assisting in the emplacement of foreign students in Singapore, is something expressly stated to be outside the purview of EAA, its rules and licence conditions. This is because the caveat is contrary to the High Court decision in the <em>IPS case</em> since the <em>Carltona</em> principle is inapplicable to the present case as explained in (b) above. As submitted by the prosecution, the defence has rightly pointed out that the TEP is a type of work pass under Regulation 2(1)(c)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 (“EFMR”) issued by the Controller of Work Passes and under Regulation 6(2)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> of the EFMR, the Controller of Work Passes is empowered to issue TEP to allow a foreigner to receive training from his employer.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_f"></a>(f)     As the <em>Carltona</em> principle is inapplicable to the present case as explained in (b) above, there is no basis for the defence contention that the High Court in the <em>IPS case</em> would have decided the case differently. If the High Court was pressed with the argument that the Commissioner's carving of the licence conditions is synonymous with the Minister's decision (based on the <em>Carltona</em> principle), it is likely that the High Court would then not have held that : <em>“The EA Licence Conditions are a set of standard conditions made by the Commissioner, not Parliament, and the meaning of “employment” within the conditions only reflects what the Commissioner intended to cover by the imposition of those conditions, and not what Parliament intended with regard to the entire EAA.”</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The defence has failed to make out a case for a reconsideration of the High Court decision in <em>the IPS case</em> based on the <em>Carltona</em> principle.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_g"></a>(g)     As it is clear that the <em>Carltona</em> principle is inapplicable to the present case as explained in (b) above and the High Court decision was not given <em>per incuriam</em>, I am unable to accept the defence contention that there was any confusion created by the licence conditions and the AP’s moral turpitude upon his conviction, so far as sentence is concerned, is minimal, if not absent thereby warranting a substantial reduction of fines as his acts were ordered on the basis that the licence conditions were valid and the AP’s acts were committed prior to the High Court decision in the <em>IPS case</em> on 6 March 2020. In this regard, I note that the High Court in the <em>IPS case</em> had held<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> that judicial pronouncements are by default retroactive in nature and there was no change in the law as the broad definition of “employment” which was found to be applicable to the provisions in question within the EAA is one that is to be read from the statutory language and clear pronouncements by Parliament as to the broad scope of the EAA and the <em>IPS case</em> has only brought that interpretation to the fore without changing the existing legal position in any way. I see no reason why this should not apply equally to the High Court decision in the <em>IPS case</em> on the meaning of “employment” within the licence conditions as only reflecting what the Commissioner intended to cover by the imposition of those conditions, and not what Parliament intended with regard to the entire EAA.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_h"></a>(h)     In <em>Forward Food Management Pte Ltd and another v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7830-M.xml')">[2002] SGHC 46</a></em> which was relied upon by the defence, the High Court had acquitted the appellant, <em>inter alia</em>, because MOM had contributed to a certain extent to the appellant’s confusion as a result of its miscommunication brought about by its application form. As submitted by the prosecution, there was no such confusion in the present case as the AP had admitted in the ASOF that he was aware that he had performed activities in connection with the employment of persons in Singapore, on his own behalf, without a valid licence from the Commissioner and hence, it does not appear that the AP was in anyway confused.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_i"></a>(i)     As the High Court in the <em>IPS case</em> had held that the fact that the EALC did not permit the emplacement of foreigners in training by licensed employment agencies did not mean that such activities could be performed by unlicensed entities and both licensed and unlicensed entities were equally prohibited from carrying out such activities, I am unable to accept the defence submission that the AP’s act in emplacing foreigners in training with the employers could be regarded as the act of an unlicensed agent authorised by the employer concerned (under the common law principles of principal and agent) and is legally permitted under the EAA as only a licensed agent is so precluded under the EAA since what is not forbidden is not disallowed for an unlicensed agent.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_j"></a>(j)     In this regard, I agreed with the prosecution that the defence submission on the AP as an agent of the employers by stepping into the shoes of the employers or acting under their authorization was not borne out in the ASOF wherein the AP had admitted that he had performed activities in connection with the employment of persons in Singapore on his own behalf, rather than on behalf of the employers and he was in the business of providing educational programmes, including the organizing of industrial attachments for overseas students in Singapore. The AP had further admitted in the ASOF that he had facilitated the placement of TEP holders from schools in India with various companies in Singapore and he had earned between $200 to $1000 from the schools (namely, Expert Solution and Modern Institute) in India from each TEP holder depending on his level of involvement. In short, the AP was not an agent acting on behalf of the employers, but was in the business of emplacing TEP holders with employers in Singapore and was in fact remunerated by the said schools in India instead of the employers as stated in the ASOF.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_k"></a>(k)     As the <em>Carltona</em> principle is inapplicable to the present case as explained in (b) above, I am unable to accept the defence submission that the prosecution has failed to prove its case or show that its proposed fines are justifiable.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION FOR THE TRIAL </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     For all the above reasons, I totally rejected the defence submissions and found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the 2 charges in DAC 935609/2019 and DAC 935610/2019 which has been preferred against the AP who is found guilty and convicted accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">SENTENCING FACTORS</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issue (d)(i)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As for the sentencing factors for an offence under section 6 of the EAA, the High Court in the <em>IPS case</em> had affirmed the District Court’s decision to take into account the following factors for the purpose of determining sentence: (a) number of successful emplacements; and (b) quantum of fees collected.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As submitted by the prosecution, the AP had admitted in the ASOF that he made about 30 emplacements and earned between $200 to $1000 for each TEP holder successfully emplaced depending on his level of involvement and that the total quantum of fees he had earned ranged between $6,000 to $30,000 in total.

In the case of <em>Vikash Kumar Gupta</em>, only 4 foreign domestic workers were successfully emplaced and profits of $2,240 were made while in the case of <em>Sun Kefang</em>, the accused did not make any profits and only 13 foreign workers were involved. The accused persons in the cases of <em>Vikash Kumar Gupta</em> and <em>Sun Kefang</em> was each charged with one offence, unlike the present case where the AP was charged with 2 offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     However, I disagreed with the prosecution and took the view that the present case is somewhat less egregious than the cases cited in the above Table of Sentencing Precedents as all the cases are distinguishable from the present case where the AP who was charged with 2 offences had emplaced about 30 TEP holders in total and had earned between $6,000 to $30,000 from the said schools in India from about November 2014 to November 2015 and from about December 2015 to August 2016. My reasons are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the case of <em>Bisno</em> where the accused was charged with one offence, the period of the offence which was from sometime in December 2016 to late March 2017 is shorter and only 2 foreign workers were involved and the accused earned about $15,200.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the case of <em>Ahad Mohammed Abdul</em> where the accused was charged with one offence, the period of the offence which was for about 3 years from sometime in July 2012 to July 2015 is longer, but only 7 foreign workers were involved and the accused collected a sum of money ranging from $8,000 to $10,500 each from the foreign employees, before passing $5,000 each to one Meyaragan S/O Alagu.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the case of <em>Muhammad Hussain</em> where the accused was charged with one offence, the period of the offence which was from sometime in March 2016 to end July 2016 is shorter and only 6 foreign workers were involved and the accused did not earn anything as none was successfully emplaced for employment in Canada.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I note that all the sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution were unreported cases for which I had to bear in mind what the High Court in <em>Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0707.xml')">[2010] 1 SLR 707</a></em> had cautioned against relying on unreported decisions indiscriminately in determining the appropriate sentence for a particular case before the court since the detailed facts and circumstances of these cases were hardly disclosed or documented with sufficient clarity to enable any intelligent comparison to be made, and comparisons based on unreported decisions are difficult and are likely to be misleading because a proper appraisal of the particular facts and circumstances is simply lacking. Further, no two cases can or will ever be completely identical or symmetrical as sentencing is neither a science nor an administrative exercise and sentences cannot be determined with mathematical certainty nor should they be arbitrary, but the sentence must fit the crime.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Based on the facts and circumstances of the present case as stated in the ASOF, I disagreed with the prosecution submission that a fine of $30,000 per charge would be appropriate. As explained in paragraphs 14(g) and (h) above, I am unable to accept as mitigating factors the defence submission on the unproven confusion created by the licence conditions and the AP’s moral turpitude upon his conviction so as to warrant a substantial reduction of the fines to be imposed on him. Having regard to the above sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution and their distinguishing features as highlighted above, I am of the view that a fine of $28,000 (in default 7 weeks’ imprisonment) for each of the 2 charges with a global fine of $56,000 (in default 14 weeks’ imprisonment) would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Accordingly, I sentenced the AP to a fine of $28,000 (in default 7 weeks’ imprisonment) for each of the 2 charges with a global fine of $56,000 (in default 14 weeks’ imprisonment). In my view, the global fine of $56,000 (in default 14 weeks’ imprisonment) was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but wholly appropriate and commensurate with the nature and extent of the AP’s culpability and was a sufficient deterrent sentence tempered with proportionality without the effect of a crushing sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The AP who is dissatisfied
