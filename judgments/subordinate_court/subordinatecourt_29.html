<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Mr Li Shun (“Mr Li”), a 29-year old Singapore Permanent Resident and his wife, Ms Lim Seow Seow (“Ms Lim”), a 35-year old Singaporean, operated an online business by selling counterfeit goods which were sourced and imported into Singapore from suppliers in China. Over a period of four years, their business made a total profit of about $60,000 to $70,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The business operations were disbanded after the police raided the couple’s residence and three other locations, which resulted in 128 infringing articles being seized. In the course of these raids, Mr Li instructed Ms Lim to dispose some counterfeit goods. Ms Lim complied by disposing 24 infringing articles into the rubbish chute in their residence. These items were subsequently recovered and seized by the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mr Li and Ms Lim were thereafter arrested and similarly charged as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     two charges under s 49(a) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (the “<em>TMA</em>”) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “<em>PC</em>”) for importing into Singapore goods with falsely applied trade marks for the purposes of trade. These charges involved 41 infringing articles and three registered trade marks; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     six charges under s 49(c) of the TMA read with s 34 of the PC for having in their possession, for purposes of trade, goods to which registered trade marks were falsely applied on them. These charges involved 87 infringing articles and five registered trade marks.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In addition, Ms Lim was charged under s 204A of the PC for intentionally obstructing the course of justice by disposing some counterfeit goods while Mr Li was charged under s 204A read with s 109 of the PC for instigating Ms Lim to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Li and Ms Lim each pleaded guilty to two charges under the TMA and their respective charge under s 204A of the PC. They each agreed for the remaining six charges under the TMA to be taken into consideration for sentencing.

However, he was unable to do so then as he was still a work permit holder. Li was eventually able to set up an online sales account on Qoo10 after Lim obtained her Singapore PR, and Li used Lim’s details in order to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Initially, the accused persons operated a legitimate online business by selling unbranded goods. However, their business was slow. Sometime from 2015 onwards, in order to increase revenue, Li sourced out counterfeit branded goods from suppliers in Guangzhou, China, to sell online. Li decided to sell counterfeits of “Longchamp” and “Kipling” branded bags as the items he sourced out were of boutique quality and they were priced slightly cheaper than their original counterparts. This change in business model caused the accused persons’ online business to flourish. Li then decided to order and sell other counterfeit models of other branded bags.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    Sometime in June 2019, Li decided to diversify the accused persons’ online business to sell counterfeit skincare products.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    Investigations revealed that Lim was at all material times aware that Li was running an online business that was selling counterfeit goods. Li oversaw the entire operations of the business, and Lim would assist Li in the running of the business by ordering the products, recording and tracking the shipment of the products. Lim further provided her UOB bank account XXX for the purposes of receiving and transferring payments from customers.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    Investigations further revealed that the total profit made by the accused persons from their sales of counterfeit goods from 2015 till the date of their arrest was about $60,000 to $70,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Up until 1 October 2019, the accused persons would order products from their suppliers twice a week and have the products delivered to the accused persons’ residence. On 1 October 2019, the Singapore Customs contacted Li to inform that a shipment of products he ordered was being withheld and directed Li to await further updates. Thereafter, in order to evade further detection of their illicit business by the authorities, Li made a decision to rent the storage space at the Pandan Loop Storage to house some of the counterfeit goods there. The rental agreement for the Pandan Loop Storage came into effect on 10 October 2019. The accused persons also kept some of the counterfeit goods in the accused persons’ vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">FACTS PERTAINING TO LI’S 3 RD CHARGE (DAC-909540-2020) AND LIM’S 3RD CHARGE (DAC-909527-2020)</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    The items listed at [5.b] were seized by the Police on 16 October 2019 at or about 11.40am, from the Airport Warehouse.

The items listed at S/No. 1 of [5.c5.b] were subsequently examined by Marilyne Serafin, the Head of Intellectual Property at Longchamp.

Li suspected that officers from the Singapore Customs had arrived to perform a raid on the accused persons’ residence. Li then instructed Lim not to open the house door to the Police and to dispose of the items listed at [5.a], which are evidence of the accused persons’ commission of offences under the Trade Marks Act, into the rubbish chute of the accused persons’ residence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.    Lim did as Li instructed.

Lim only opened the door to the accused persons’ residence to the Police when Li returned home. Upon Li’s return, both accused persons admitted to the Police that they had disposed of the items listed at [5.a] into the rubbish chute of the accused persons’ residence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.    By instigating Lim to intentionally obstruct the course of justice by disposing of the items listed at [5.a], which act was committed in consequence of his abetment, Li has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A read with Section 109 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">CONCLUSION</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.    In total, the total quantity of infringing articles concerned in all the charges against both accused persons in 128.

Having considered both Mr Li and Ms Lim’s levels of culpability, the Prosecution submitted that at least one week’s imprisonment for the charges under s 204A of the PC would be appropriate for each of them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the sentences for all three proceeded charges should run consecutively as they related to separate legal interests as well as concerned separate and distinct transactions of the accused persons’ offending conduct.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defence’s submissions on sentence and mitigation plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Counsel for the Defence, Mr Nair, submitted that in 2014, to supplement the family income, Mr Li used Ms Lim’s details to start a small-scale online business to sell goods. This business was legitimate and yielded small amounts of money. In around 2015, Mr Li then changed the business model to sell counterfeit goods. Ms Lim, who was unable to work due to her medical conditions, assisted Mr Li in the online business. The net profits from the business were used for the family’s expenses. Submissions were also made in respect of the couple’s personal circumstances prior and subsequent to the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In mitigation, Mr Nair submitted that the couple were first-time offenders. They had pleaded guilty and were extremely remorseful of their actions. Both Mr Li and Ms Lim’s level of involvement in the offences were low. The online business, which was small and home-based, did not have any employees. There was no degree of permanence. There was no physical shop displaying the goods publicly. The business operations were not syndicated, unsophisticated and easily detectable. The number of infringing articles was small and mostly involved bags. Compensation of $19,000, which amounted to about 30% of the total profit made by the couple, was paid to two out of three of the trade marks rights holders. It was highlighted by Mr Nair that the remaining trade marks rights holder declined to receive compensation. As regards the s 204A charge, it was submitted that the couple was foolish and acted on the spur of the moment. Their actions stemmed from shock, panic and/or desperation as the police were outside the couple’s residence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For Mr Li, Mr Nair initially sought a global sentence of less than two to two months’ (for the TMA charges) and one week’s (for the PC charge) imprisonment. After voluntary compensation was made, Mr Nair’s sentencing position for the TMA charges was revised to a global imprisonment term of no more than one month. For the s 204A charge, Mr Nair sought a fine. On the day of sentencing, Mr Nair again revised the sentencing position and sought fines for the TMA charges. Mr Nair explained that Mr Li’s permanency residency in Singapore might be or could be in danger of being revoked should an imprisonment term be imposed by the court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For Ms Lim, Mr Nair initially sought a fine of $700 per article for the TMA charges and a fine for the PC charge. No submissions were made on the quantum of the proposed fine in respect of the PC charge. After voluntary compensation was made, Mr Nair sought a revised fine of $350 per article for the TMA charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Although Mr Nair’s final sentencing position was that fines should be imposed on the couple, he also made submissions on the computation of global sentence if the court was minded to impose imprisonment terms. Mr Nair submitted that the sentences for the TMA offences should run concurrently as the offences were not separate and distinct offences. Instead, the offences under ss 49(a) and (c) of the TMA formed part of the same transactional conduct and enterprise.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s reply submissions </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In reply, the Prosecution submitted that the fact that there was no physical shop did not lead to the conclusion that there was no permanence of the business. The couple had a clear online presence and their use of the internet was a relevant aggravating factor that should be taken into consideration: see <em>PP v Syamsul Hilal bin Ismail v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 1 SLR 0973.xml')">[2012] 1 SLR 973</a> (at [36]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Insofar as the s 204A charges were concerned, the Prosecution submitted that as the predicate offences under the TMA were serious, the couple’s act of obstruction of justice should also be treated as being serious: see <em>Seah Hock Thiam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0136.xml')">[2013] SGHC 136</a> (at [8]). The Prosecution submitted that the courts have typically imposed sentences ranging from two weeks to four months’ imprisonment for similar cases.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Lastly, the Prosecution submitted that considering the charges in totality and duration of offending behaviour, all three sentences should be ordered to run consecutively. Overall, the Prosecution’s position was that fines would not be appropriate in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Charges under TMA</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing principles and sentencing framework</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The primary sentencing consideration in cases of trade marks infringement is deterrence. As expressed by Chao Hick Tin JA in <em>Goik</em> at [18], strong intellectual property protection was an integral component of Singapore’s economic and industrial policy, and was vital to our economic success.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Equally important was the principle of proportionality which would act as a counterbalance to the principle of deterrence in that the sentence imposed on the offender must be commensurate with the gravity of the offence: <em>see Goik</em> at [22].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In arriving at my decision, I was guided by the two-step sentencing framework for offences under s 49(c) of the TMA set out by Chao JA in <em>Goik</em> (at [31]), <em>ie</em>, first, to consider the nature and extent of the infringement, and the manner in which the infringements were carried out, and second, to examine whether there were any other relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Chao JA held (at [32]) that an appropriate starting point would be the offender’s level of involvement in the operation. He set out three levels of involvement and the sentencing range for each category (at [33] to [35] and [38]):</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     High involvement would include cases where an offender had been heavily involved in sourcing for, distributing and selling infringing articles, hiring employees to help him run the illegitimate business, and offenders who applied the infringing trade marks to the goods. The sentencing range would be from 10 to 20 months’ imprisonment for each charge.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     Moderate involvement would include cases where an offender obtained the infringing articles from another supplier and distributed them or sold them out of a shop unit. The sentencing range would be from six to seven months’ imprisonment for each charge.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     Low involvement would include cases where an offender was merely an employee who was manning a shop selling counterfeit goods. The sentencing range would be from two to four months’ imprisonment for each charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Crucially, Chao JA held (at [36]) that one factor which might be useful in determining whether the custodial threshold has been crossed was whether the offender had some sort of permanence in dealing with the infringing articles.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the subsequent decision of <em>Tan</em>, Chao JA refined and elaborated on the <em>Goik</em> sentencing framework. He held (at [14]) that the sentencing framework merely provided a starting point and that the sentencing court should also have regard to the following non-exhaustive list of factors when determining the actual sentence to be meted out:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     the size of the offender’s business;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     the number of employees;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     the financial figures in terms of revenue and profits;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether a syndicate was involved;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_e"></a>(e)     the number of infringing articles involved;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_f"></a>(f)     the nature and value of the infringing articles;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_g"></a>(g)     the duration of the infringement;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_h"></a>(h)     the manner of infringement and the degree of permanence in the offender’s dealings with the infringing articles; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_i"></a>(i)     whether compensation was made to the trade marks rights holders.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Given the similarity in nature of offences and the interests to be protected, I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentencing principles and framework for s 49(c) of the TMA equally applied to offences under s 49(a) of the TMA.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing precedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As stated earlier at [17], I have taken guidance from the four precedent cases in the Table in arriving at my decision. Details of these cases are set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Goh</em>¸ the offender pleaded guilty to five charges under s 49(c) of the TMA. 10 similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender was the proprietor of the business which sold infringing apparel and bags from makeshift stalls in housing estates. He sourced for shops leased by the Housing and Development Board with shop fronts available for daily rental. He appeared to have operated two shops and was assisted by his wife. The duration of infringement was close to two years. This case involved a total of 4,130 infringing articles. No information on the financial figures of the business was provided. The offender, who was untraced, did not make compensation. His involvement was classified as moderate. The offender was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for charges involving 886 infringing articles, and one month’s imprisonment for charges involving 261 infringing articles. The offender’s appeal was withdrawn.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Goik</em>, the offender pleaded guilty to one charge under s 49(c) of the TMA and three charges under the Copyright Act. Twelve charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He was the proprietor of the business which sold infringing bedding products from two permanent shops and occasional makeshift stalls at night markets or heartland areas. He sourced for the infringing items himself. He employed one driver and four sales assistants. The duration of infringement was about two years. This case involved a total of 8,957 infringing articles with 3,015 articles which infringed the TMA. The business made a profit of $9 per infringing article<em>, ie</em>, a total profit of $80,613 for all charges including $27,135 for TMA charges. The offender, who was untraced, made voluntary compensation of $100,000. Having classified the offender’s involvement to be moderate to high, Chao JA sentenced the offender to six months’ imprisonment for each TMA charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Tan</em>, the offender pleaded guilty to 11 charges under s 49(c) of the TMA with 46 similar charges being taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender started assisting her boyfriend, who operated three shops in City Plaza selling counterfeit luxury goods sourced from China. After her boyfriend was imprisoned for unrelated charges, the offender took over the running of the business and kept it in operation. She drew a fixed salary and treated the business’ profits as that belonging to her boyfriend. Out of the three shops, two were subsequently closed. The business hired two assistants and operated for about one year under the offender’s management. In total, there were more than 6,000 infringing articles. The profits made were variable, ranging from a few dollars to $60 per item. No compensation was made. Chao JA found that the offender’s level of involvement placed her within the lower end of the moderate category. For charges involving up to 44 infringing articles, an imprisonment term of two months per charge was imposed. Her total sentence was nine months’ imprisonment. Chao JA also noted that if it were not for the payment of compensation, the imprisonment sentence imposed on the offender in <em>Goik</em> would have been longer than <em>Tan</em>’s case (see <em>Tan</em> at [31]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>Chan</em>, the offender pleaded guilty to five charges under s 49(c) of the TMA with 16 similar charges being taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender and her husband ran a retail business selling both unbranded and counterfeit luxury goods from one shop unit. The couple travelled to Hong Kong to source and procure goods. She employed two assistants. Access to the shop was limited to regular customers who made appointments to view or buy goods. The duration of infringement was about two years. This case involved a total of 178 infringing articles. The financial figures of the business were unknown. The learned District Judge classified the offender’s involvement to be on the lower end of the moderate category. The offender, who was untraced, made voluntary compensation of $125,000. The offender was sentenced to a total fine of $133,500, in default 13 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution’s appeal was withdrawn.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I noted that the decision in <em>Goh</em> pre-dated the High Court decisions in <em>Goik</em> and <em>Tan</em>. Additionally, the cases of <em>Goh</em> and <em>Chan</em> were decided in the District Court by judges of concurrent jurisdiction. Whilst I made comparisons between the present case and the cases of <em>Goh</em> and <em>Chan</em>, I did not consider myself bound by either of these decisions.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasons for my decision on the sentences</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Degree of permanence and duration</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In determining the appropriate sentences, an important preliminary consideration I bore in mind was the degree of permanence in the couple’s dealings with the infringing articles: <em>Goik</em> at [36]. I agreed with the Prosecution that the absence of a physical shop did not mean there was no permanence of the business. With the advent of technology, there was a similar or potentially higher degree of permanence in the present case compared with the cases of <em>Goh</em>, <em>Goik</em>, <em>Tan</em> and <em>Chan</em>. Foremost, the use of an online platform gave the couple greater reach, enabling the business to function unhampered by operating hours (unlike that of brick-and-mortar shops in <em>Goh</em>, <em>Goik</em>, <em>Tan</em> and <em>Chan</em> ) or customers (unlike <em>Chan</em> where access to counterfeit goods was limited to a certain class of customers). By operating from a permanent online shop on the Qoo10 platform, counterfeit goods were offered for sale to all and sundry. Ready and willing customers could make purchases of counterfeit goods at any time, at their convenience.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Moreover, I found the duration of infringements to be significantly long. Mr Li and Ms Lim had operated their online business for about four years while the business operations in the precedent cases set out in the Table lasted for about one to two years. The fact that the couple’s online business existed for a period of four years demonstrated the permanence and enduring nature of their business. Accordingly, taking guidance from <em>Goik</em>, I found that the couple’s business operated with a degree of permanence and a custodial sentence was an appropriate starting point.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Level of culpability</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In relation to the couple’s level of culpability. I agreed with the Prosecution that Mr Li’s involvement would fall within the “moderate” category. Mr Li was the <em>de facto</em> owner and directing mind of the business. He was the one who changed the model of the business from a legitimate small-scale online shop to one that sold counterfeit goods. He sourced for the counterfeit goods and determined which were of boutique quality before deciding to offer them for sale to his customers. He made the decision to diversify the business from selling counterfeit branded bags to include counterfeit skincare products. Under <em>Goik</em>, the level of involvement for an offender like Mr Li was classified as “moderate” and the starting point for sentence would be in the region of six to seven months’ imprisonment per charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I agreed with both the Prosecution and Defence that Ms Lim’s level of culpability fell under the “low” category. The business account with Qoo10 was registered in her name. Payments from customers were made to her bank account. She placed orders, received goods, as well as recorded and tracked shipments. Although Ms Lim played an active and pivotal role in the business’ operations, ultimately her job was to assist her husband and act in accordance with his instructions. Under the <em>Goik</em> framework, even for offenders with a low level of involvement, the starting point would be an imprisonment term. Here, Ms Lim’s level of culpability would attract a starting sentence in the region of two to four months’ imprisonment per charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Scale of business operations</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The scale of business operations in the present case was much smaller than that in <em>Goik</em> and <em>Tan</em>’s cases. I noted that, unlike <em>Goik</em>, <em>Tan</em> and <em>Chan</em>, the business was run by the couple without any employees or assistants. Their business was rather self-contained and conducted in two stages: first, to import the counterfeit goods into Singapore, and second, to offer them for sale to their customers. Mr Li and Ms Lim were not part of a syndicate or an organised criminal effort concerned with the manufacture, sale or distribution of counterfeit items (see <em>Goik</em> at [41]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Number of infringing articles</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The total number of infringing articles in the present case was 128, which was lower than that in the cases set out in the Table.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Total profit made and voluntary compensation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The total profit made in the present case (<em>ie</em>, $60,000 to $70,000) was lower than that in <em>Goik</em>, where $80,613 was made. I further noted that voluntary compensation, though belated, was collectively made by the couple to two out of three of the affected parties.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Insofar as compensation vis-à-vis profit was concerned, the compensation made in the present case amounted to about 30% of the total profit made. This represented a significantly smaller proportion of compensation as compared to that in <em>Goik</em>, where the compensation made was about 124% of the total profit. Nonetheless, in my view, payment of voluntary compensation remained a mitigating factor that warranted a discount to the starting point sentence though not to the same extent as that in <em>Goik</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   Other factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I found little merit in the submission that, by an imprisonment term, Mr Li’s permanent residency in Singapore might be revoked. Any collateral consequences that flowed from Mr Li’s actions to engage in criminal conduct was his to bear. All things being equal, there was no good reason why a permanent resident who had chosen to make Singapore his home should receive more lenient sentences than a Singaporean. If I were to accept Mr Nair’s submission as a mitigating factor, I would have inevitably favoured permanent residents over Singaporeans, and promoted inequality and discrimination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     While I noted that Mr Li and Ms Lim had each pleaded guilty, I was mindful of the fact that they were caught red-handed. Under these circumstances, the weight attached to their pleas of guilt had to be tempered accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In my final analysis, I saw no exceptional mitigating factors to justify a departure from the usual custodial sentences imposed in such cases. For reasons expounded above, in particular the number of infringing articles, total profit made and voluntary compensation paid, I was of the view that the couple’s culpability was lower than that of the offenders in <em>Goik</em> and <em>Tan</em>. Accordingly, I gave a significant calibration downwards and imposed a sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment on Mr Li and 10 days’ imprisonment on Ms Lim for each TMA charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Charges under s 204A of the PC </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing principles and precedent</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the commentary on offences under s 204A of the PC in the <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em> (3<sup>rd</sup> Ed Vol II) at p 1080, the following observation was made:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Undoubtedly, the sentencing philosophy underpinning the commission of such offences would be general deterrence. Offences under s204A of the Penal Code are offences against the institution of justice and they contaminate the rule of law. For this reason, the default starting sentence for an offence under s 204A of the Penal Code should be a custodial one.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For offences under s 204A of the PC, as accepted in <em>PP v Tay Tong Chuan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23003-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 58</a> (at [34]), the following factors would be relevant:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     the gravity of the predicate matter in which justice was sought to be obstructed;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     the manner in which justice was sought to be obstructed;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_c"></a>(c)     the duration of misconduct;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_d"></a>(d)     potential harm that could arise from the misconduct; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_e"></a>(e)     whether and how the offender stood to gain from obstructing justice.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Prosecution referred the court to the case of <em>PP v Li Na</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17951-SSP.xml')">[2015] SGDC 260</a>; MA 9142-2015-01 (“<em>Li Na</em>”), where the offender faced one charge under s 204A read with s 109 of the PC. She was detained at Changi Airport on suspicion of committing TMA offences. While detained, the offender sent an SMS to her husband, asking him to fetch her shop assistant to her shop to remove counterfeit goods. She also contacted her shop assistant with the same instructions. The offender’s husband and shop assistant did as instructed by removing most of the counterfeit goods from the shop and placing them in her husband’s car. In total, 422 items were subsequently seized by the police. The offender was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment. The offender’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Prosecution submitted that the facts of the present case justified a downward calibration to a one-week imprisonment for the couple. While Mr Nair agreed with the Prosecution that a downward adjustment from the sentence imposed in <em>Li Na</em> should be applied to the present case, Mr Nair did not refer the court to any case in support of his submissions for the imposition of a fine.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasons for my decision on the sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I found that the case of <em>Li Na</em> to be a useful precedent as it concerned offences under TMA and involved a similar factual matrix to the present case. The predicate offences under the TMA were serious offences. Through their actions, Mr Li and Ms Lim clearly intended to erase evidence of their transgression and deprive the police of important evidence that was relevant to the investigations against them. Having considered the sentencing principles and the facts, I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case, like <em>Li Na</em>, warranted a custodial sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In determining the appropriate length of sentence, I found Mr Li and Ms Lim’s culpability to be lower than that of the offender in <em>Li Na</em>. Unlike the offender in <em>Li Na</em>, the couple’s actions took place <em>before</em> they were detained by the authorities. The number of infringing articles involved in the s 204A of the PC charge in <em>Li Na</em> was much higher than that in the present case. The couple’s admission of their misconduct to the police was prompt. Based on the timings set out in the charges under s 204A of the PC and the TIC charge, DAC-909526-2020, I noted that the incriminating evidences were seized shortly, <em>viz.</em> about one hour and 25 minutes, after the offence was committed. Given that Mr Li was the one who instructed the disposal of the counterfeit goods, I was of the view that his culpability was higher than Ms Lim’s. Taking this into account, I imposed an imprisonment term of one week on Mr Li and five days on Ms Lim.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for my decision on the global sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Having determined the individual sentences, I considered how the individual sentences should be ordered to run. By virtue of s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012), at least two out of the three sentences had to run consecutively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Taking guidance from <em>PP v Raveen Balakrishnan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22604-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 799</a> (“<em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em>”) at [41], as a general rule, an offender who had committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and the individual sentences should run consecutively. It was clear to me that the charge under s 204A of the PC was distinct from the two charges under the TMA, and should be ordered to run consecutively. As regards the two charges under the TMA, the issues before me were whether: (a) they were distinct and unrelated; and (b) if so, whether the imposition of three consecutive sentences for the proceeded charges was warranted in this case. In arriving at my decision, I was mindful that a decision to impose three consecutive sentences ought not to be lightly made, and serious consideration should be applied: see <em>ADF v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0874.xml')">[2010] 1 SLR 874</a> at [146].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     While the two charges under the TMA disclosed two distinct offences in law, I considered whether they were committed as part of one transaction: see <em>Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a> at [27]. As part of this enquiry, I considered whether the TMA offences entailed a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest”: see <em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em> at [39]. In determining this, proximities in time, place, continuity of action, and continuity in purpose or design have utility.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I agreed with Mr Nair that the two TMA offences were connected and formed part of the same transaction. Both offences were committed simultaneously or close together in time. Flowing from the offence of importation of counterfeit goods, the couple had in their possession such goods which were then offered for sale to customers. I was also satisfied that both offences violated the same legally protected interest <em>ie</em>, the right to have registered trade marks protected.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     However, it was well-accepted that the one-transaction rule was not an absolute rule and could be displaced in order to give effect to the principle of deterrence: <em>see Kanagasuntharam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 2 SLR(R) 0874.xml')">[1991] 2 SLR(R) 874</a> at [6]; <em>Seng Foo Building Construction Pte Ltd v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19922-SSP.xml')">[2017] 3 SLR 201</a> at [67].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It was clear to me that our national interests and efforts to put in place robust intellectual property protection laws would be undermined if a sufficiently stiff sentence was not imposed on the couple. To this end, I can do no better than to refer to these observations by District Judge Aedit Abdullah (as he then was) in <em>PP v Md Hapiz bin Tahir</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/52661-M.xml')">[2007] SGDC 40</a> (“<em>Md Hapiz</em>”) (at [9] to [10]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    The repercussion of criminal activity goes beyond national boundaries however. There is considerable attention paid to the size and degree of intellectual property right infringement, and the national reputation can be easily imperilled if it is perceived that the law is too lenient in dealing with offenders. Failure to protect property rights adequately can also attract sanctions and detriment for the country concerned.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    All of these therefore point to a high degree of seriousness that should be accorded to intellectual property right infringement, and the sentences imposed should accordingly reflect that high degree of seriousness.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The ease at which intellectual property crimes might be committed coupled with the use of an online platform for criminal purposes justified a strong need for deterrence in the present case. I shared the observations of the court in <em>Md Hapiz</em> (at [12]) that the nature of intellectual property crimes was such that it could be carried out with greater ease than other property offences. After all, there was no need to deprive the trade mark rights holders of physical possession. An offender just needed to reproduce an infringing trade mark on an article or source for infringing articles. Once the infringing articles were obtained, they were offered for sale. Here, the use of the internet and an online platform were central to the couple’s business and might have contributed to the longevity of their business. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was a strong public interest to deter potential offenders from using the Internet to have greater reach. Thus, to combat intellectual property crimes especially where an online medium was used, I was of the view that it was necessary to have a strong deterrent response.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I was also concerned about the financial incentive to commit intellectual property related crimes. Mr Li restructured their legitimate online business to one that sold counterfeit branded bags, as part of a calculated and deliberate plan to obtain profit. Arising from the change in business model, the couple’s online business flourished, and revenue increased. Subsequently, their business offerings expanded to include more infringing articles. The couple’s trajectory indicated a significant financial incentive to commit intellectual property offences. This reinforced the need for strong deterrence so that like-minded persons would not contemplate duplicating such acts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the interest of deterrence, I was of the view that all three individual sentences against Mr Li and Ms Lim should run consecutively. As a final check to assess whether the overall sentence yielded by the combination of the consecutive sentences was excessive, I considered the totality principle. The aggregate sentences against Mr Li and Ms Lim were 11 weeks’ and 25 days’ imprisonment respectively. Considering their respective overall criminality and the precedent cases in the Table, I was satisfied that the aggregate sentences were fair, and no adjustments to the individual sentences were necessary.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     To summarise, I imposed the following sentences on Mr Li and Ms Lim:</p> <table align="left"
