class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 3 February 2020, the High Court ordered that this matter be remitted to the trial judge to take further evidence from an additional under s 392(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). The High Court further directed that the trial court provide a finding and a determination whether its previous decision was affected by the said additional evidence in accordance with s 392(4) of the CPC.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As the trial judge had since retired from service, pursuant to s 297(1) of the CPC, I was assigned to hear and determine the matter as directed by the High Court. I now set out the effect, if any, that the additional evidence taken would have had on the trial judge’s earlier verdict.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trial</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The accused was convicted after a trial of one charge for the consumption of methamphetamine, a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185) (“MDA”), commonly referred to as an “LT2” offence. He was sentenced to serve seven years and six months’ imprisonment and to the mandatory sentence of six strokes of the cane with effect from 7 May 2018. The accused appealed against his conviction and the sentence imposed. The trial judge’s reasons are set out in <em>Public Prosecutor v</em> Annadurai <em>s/o Periyasamy</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23173-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 104</a> (“GD”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       During the course of the trial, the accused, then appearing in person, denied that he had consumed methamphetamine and had raised a spiking defence. This defence was addressed at [22] – [26] of the GD.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       He had alleged that one “Nasir”, a male Malay, aged between 50-52 years of age, and living on the second floor of Block 168 Bukit Batok West Avenue had spiked a drink of banana flavoured milk. The Investigation Officer made attempts to locate this witness based on the information provided by the accused, but he was unsuccessful. Eventually, this witness was located and identified as one Mr Mohammad Nasir bin Matrabi (“Nasir”). The matter was brought to the attention of the High Court Judge hearing the appeal and His Honour accordingly remitted the case for Nasir’s evidence to be taken.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The accused’s own evidence at trial was that on 15 February 2018 between 0800 – 0900 hrs, he had gone to Nasir’s house located on the second floor of Block 168 Bukit Batok Avenue to ask Nasir to join him in some “karang guni” work.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The accused then felt thirsty and asked Nasir for a drink. He went to the fridge and took a packet of banana milk, from among a few packets that were in the fridge, and went back to the master bedroom to drink it. Nasir then suddenly left the room and returned with a small glass with red flowers and green leaves painted on it. The accused then poured the milk into the glass and drank it. He felt sleepy after drinking it and fell asleep. His wallet was beside him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       When he woke up, he took his wallet and put it in his pocket without checking it. He left the flat with Nasir. On the first floor, the accused had a stomach-ache and went to look for a toilet while Nasir rode off on his bicycle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Later, the accused checked his wallet and discovered that seven $50 notes were missing. This was when he realised that the drink had been spiked. The accused was angry and went back to Nasir’s block. He shouted for Nasir, but Nasir did not reply although it appeared that he was home because the accused had heard music coming from the house. He was so angry that he called the police. Unfortunately, when the police arrived, it was the accused was arrested for the suspected consumption of drugs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The trial judge found that the accused had failed to rebut the presumptions under the MDA. The trial judge was of the view that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the accused’s allegation that the drink was spiked by Nasir was simply a mere allegation;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     it was incredible that the accused could determine with certainty that the glass was spiked and when he had admitted that he did not check the glass before pouring the milk;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     that was no compelling reason for Nasir to spike his drink.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Accordingly, the trial judge found the accused guilty and convicted him of the LT1 offence. The accused was sentenced to seven years and six months’ imprisonment and to of six strokes of the cane with effect from 7 May 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Evidence Mohammad Nasir bin Matrabi (PW9)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Nasir is the alleged spiker and lives at Block 168 Bukit Batok Avenue 8, #XXX. The accused is known to Nasir. He was described as a normal friend and did not come to his home often. However, Nasir acknowledges that the accused had come to his home previously, but he is unable to say whether that occasion was on 15 February 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Nasir’s evidence was that on that occasion that the accused had come to his home, the accused asked whether he could have a drink. He therefore went to the fridge and took a packet of banana flavoured milk and brought it to the accused. He poured the milk into a white glass in front of the accused. Later, they left the flat together as Nasir wanted to go to the shops.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Nasir, however, denied the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ever having discussed with the accused about entering into a partnership to do “karang guni” work;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     That it was the accused who had gone to fridge to take the milk;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     That after the accused opened the packet of milk and started to drink directly from it, he, Nasir, went out and brought back a small glass cup with green leaf and a red flower printed on it;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     That he had put methamphetamine in the said cup in order to drug the accused, causing the accused to pass out, so that he could steal money from the accused’s wallet because he was unemployed;</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submission of the parties</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submission</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Prosecution submitted that there was no basis to disturb the trial judge’s decision. First, there was also no evidence that methamphetamine would cause the intended effect claimed, namely, to cause the person to pass out. There was no evidence that Nasir wanted to drug the accused to steal his money because he was unemployed and was in financial need. Nasir had refuted the allegations that he was in financial difficulties and even added that he did not even know that the accused had money in his wallet when the latter came to his house. There was no reason for Nasir to steal the accused’s monies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Nasir had confirmed that there was no such glass fitting the accused’s description of that he alleged that the spiked drink was contained in. The Prosecution submitted that the trial judge had rightly noted at [25] of the GD that the accused “could not say with any certainty” that the glass “was not empty” as “he did not check the glass before pouring the milk into it”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It was also submitted by the Prosecution that the accused was clearly not worthy of credit as he had mounted various defences during his trial. These included his initial claim that he was on mediation but subsequently abandoned after hearing the evidence from the analysts from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) that the medication would not give rise to the presence of methamphetamine in his urine.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defences’ submission</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Defence submitted that the spiking defence was now no longer a “mere” allegation as the alleged spiker had been found. It could be proven that Nasir wanted to steal money from the accused and that was why he spiked the drink. It was submitted that parts of Nasir’s testimony now corroborated with that of the accused, in particular, it was pointed out that Nasir could have met the accused at his flat on 15 February 2018 between 0800 hrs – 0900 hrs as Nasir was not in custody during that period of time; that Nasir had glass cups at home; that Nasir had conceded that accused had drunk banana flavoured in his flat and that he and owned a bicycle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Defence contrasted the evidence of the accused and Nasir. It was submitted that Nasir was being evasive about what happened in the flat. Nasir had denied spiking the accused’s drink because to admit it would expose him to criminal charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Defence also highlighted the effects of consuming methamphetamine taken from the website of the Central Narcotics Bureau. This said that the consumption of the drug is scientifically known to cause, <em>inter alia</em>, disorientation and confused exhaustion as its side effects, a fact that the court could take judicial notice of. It was also submitted that there was no evidence to contradict the accused’s evidence that methamphetamine would cause him to fall asleep as his evidence was not challenged in cross examination.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I accept the Defence’s submission that the spiking defence was now no longer a “mere” allegation. It is true that the alleged spiker has been identified and brought to court. As per [23] of the GD, the very least had now been done. Nonetheless, the onus is still be on the accused to rebut the presumption under the MDA that he had knowingly consumed methamphetamine that day, on a balance of probabilities. The court is not obliged to accept the accused’s defence that his drink was spiked, at face value.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There was some dispute as to who took out the banana flavoured milk from the fridge, Nasir or the accused. In my view, this is not important because the accused’s allegation was that the methamphetamine was in the glass from which he drank the milk. However, I have referred to this simply because, although Nasir had denied many things, he had specifically remembered that on one occasion, the accused had come to his flat and he had taken out some milk, specifically banana flavoured, from the fridge, poured it out into a cup and gave it to the accused. If it was indeed, as the Defence suggested, that his denials were simply an attempt not to incriminate himself in some way, it made no sense as to why he would specifically mention this fact in his evidence. It would have made more sense if Nasir had simply not mentioned anything about the milk, or simply put, deny everything. If he had done so, there would have been no thing for the Defence to show that the accused had consumed any milk of any flavour in Nasir’s flat, let alone one that was banana flavoured. No one would be the wiser.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Contrary to the Defence’s submission, I am unable to agree that <em>“…. it can now be proven that Mr Nasir wanted to steal from Mr Annadurai and that was why Mr Annadurai was spiked.”</em> There was nothing in evidence to suggest that this was the case, let alone prove it. In fact, Nasir had categorically denied that he had stolen any of the accused monies. He also denied that he was in financial difficulties. There does not appear to be any compelling reason why Nasir would spike the Accused’s drink to steal from his wallet when, as admitted by the accused in his own cross-examination, Nasir did not even know how much the accused had in his wallet.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In my view, Nasir would have taken a big risk if he did indeed spike the accused’s drink. He would be spiking someone in his own home, and it would be easier for a victim to deduce what had happened and he would be doing this for a return that appeared to be vague, or at best, small. This made the scenario spun by the accused, that Nasir spiked the banana flavoured milk in order to steal from him, very unlikely. In fact, it did not sound logical.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I note that the Defence has suggested that had was no evidence to contradict the Accused’s evidence that methamphetamine would cause him to fall asleep as his evidence was not challenged in cross examination. I assume that therefore, the Defence is submitting that his evidence should be preferred. I did not accept this this submission. The accused’s evidence is not before this court. There is no medical or expert evidence as to the effect of methamphetamine on a person (for example, whether it makes a person more alert or sleepy), whether there is a difference in it’s effect on a new user viz an addict and perhaps how much of the drug would cause the effect. Hence, I did not make any determination in this respect.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The trial judge had explained her reasons for convicting the accused. This was mainly due to the fact that no spiker was called to give evidence. Having now heard the evidence of the alleged spiker, Nasir, I was of the view that the accused had still failed to rebut, on the balance of probabilities, the presumption that he had knowingly consumed the methamphetamine found in his urine sample.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I thus concluded that the evidence of Nasir would have had no effect on the trial judge’s decision to convict the accused.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap9 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
