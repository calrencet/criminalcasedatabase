At the material time, she was a domestic maid employed by the accused. The victim came to Singapore for the first time to work on 16 July 2016.

The Accused scolded the victim for keeping all the metal bowls in the cupboard, instead of leaving three bowls on the shelves. The Accused took two to three of the bowls out from the cupboard.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused then held the rim of one of the bowls in her right hand and used the bowl to hit the left side of the victim’s head. The base of the bowl contacted with the victim’s head, causing her pain.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim saw that the bowl was slightly dented thereafter. Prior to the Accused hitting the victim’s head with the bowl, there was no dent on the bowl.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim then approached the Accused’s husband, who was in the living room, and informed him that she wanted to be transferred to the agency. The Accused told her that she was not allowed to be transferred. She also scolded the victim for talking to her husband.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts pertaining to the 6th Charge (MAC 903131-2019)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in August 2016 in the Flat, the victim was instructed by the Accused’s mother-in-law to boil Chinese herbs. The victim did so before she proceeded to wash the toilets. As a result, the victim had to shower at a later timing. Before she could do so, the Accused arrived home and the accused asked her why she was bathing at a later time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim explained the situation and the Accused scolded her. The Accused then answered a call on the cordless phone in the Flat. After the Accused finished the call, she used the cordless phone to hit the victim on the top of her head once. The victim felt pain. However, the victim remained standing in front of the Accused as one of the rules given by the Accused was that she was to stay still when the Accused was angry at the victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim requested for a transfer. The Accused refused and stated that she would instead transfer the victim to India.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts pertaining to the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge (MAC 903126-2019)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 September 2016 in the morning, in the living room of the Flat, the Accused instructed the victim to change her four-year-old son’s clothes. The Accused watched the victim while the victim changed the clothes. The Accused scolded the victim for putting on her son’s pants wrongly. At around 7.00 a.m., the Accused used her hand to slap the victim’s face. It was a hard slap, which caused the victim pain and her nose to bleed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused subsequently left the Flat with her son. The victim decided to leave the Flat. She took her belongings and she walked to Jalan Kayu. At that point in time, the victim had not received any of her salary from the Accused and she only had some coins, which she had brought with her from Indonesia. At the bus stop at Jalan Kayu, the victim sought help from the informant, who called the police. The victim was subsequently conveyed to the hospital by the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical report by Dr Lin Yingcui Annette of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital stated that on examination, the victim’s nasal bridge was tender.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">ANTECEDENTS</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused does not have any previous convictions.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment based on the following breakdown:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_i"></a>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAC 903216/19 (hard slap): 3 months (consecutive);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_ii"></a>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAC 903128/19 (hit head with metal bowl): 5 months (consecutive); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_iii"></a>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAC 903131/19 (hit head with cordless phone): 4 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution relied on the case of <em>ADF v PP</em> [2010] 1 SLR 898 (“<em>ADF</em>”) to submit that any offences involving the use of violence on the part of employers against domestic maids would invariably face a custodial sentence as a starting point unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Prosecution submitted that this is not an exceptional case justifying such a departure.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted that based on the medical report of Dr Cheow Enquan (“Dr Cheow”) from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) as well as his clarification reports, the Accused had suffered “from depression with anxiety features and was probably having an episode of post-natal depression at the material time”. He was of the view that there was only a “partial contributory link” to the Accused’s offences as opposed to a direct link. Dr Cheow opined that the Accused’s “ability to exercise self-control and restraint during the commission of the offences was impaired due to her depressed and irritable state at the material time but this was only to a partial extent”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution thus distinguished the present case from two other cases where fines only were imposed where the mental disorders were more severe and had a greater link to the offending behaviours.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cited the case of <em>Soh Mei Yun v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 3 SLR 0299.xml')">[2014] 3 SLR 299</a> (“<em>Soh Mei Yun</em>”), where the accused was found to be suffering from major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder at the time of the offences and these conditions were contributory causes of her offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case cited was <em>Chong Yee Ka v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20696-SSP.xml')">[2017] 4 SLR 309</a> (“<em>Chong Yee Ka</em>”) where the accused was found to be suffering from major depressive disorder of moderate severity and a mild form of obsessive-compulsive disorder, secondary to her depressive disorder and that this had a direct and causal link to the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution then relied on the sentencing approach and range of guideline sentences laid down in the case of <em>Tay Wee Kiat and another v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22301-SSP.xml')">[2018] 4 SLR 1315</a> (“<em>Tay Wee Kiat</em>”), with indicative ranges corresponding to the degree of harm caused in the form of a table:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="33.46%" /> <col width="33.26%" /> <col width="33.28%" /> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Less serious physical harm</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>More serious physical harm</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Less serious psychological harm</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3-6 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6-18 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>More serious psychological harm</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6-18 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20-30 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left" /> <br clear="left" /> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying to the facts, the Prosecution submitted that for the charge MAC 903216-2019, it falls under the category of less serious psychological and physical harm but at the higher end of the range i.e. 6 months’ imprisonment for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_i"></a>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The force used in slapping the victim’s face was great, causing the victim’s nose to bleed; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_ii"></a>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after this incident, the Accused slapped the victim’s face causing redness on the cheek and a ringing sound the victim’s ear (the TIC charge (MAC 903217-2019).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution then calibrated the proposed sentence downwards to 3 months’ imprisonment, taking into account the Accused’s plea of guilt and post-natal depression.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the charge of MAC 903128-2019 involving the use of a metal bowl to hit the victim’s head, the Prosecution submitted that this charge is at the upper end of the spectrum of less serious psychological and physical harm. However, they submitted for an uplift to 10 months’ imprisonment for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_i"></a>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the use of an instrument;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_ii"></a>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident happened just two weeks after the victim started working for the Accused.

They proposed an uplift to 8 months’ imprisonment to take into the account the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_i"></a>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the use of an instrument; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_ii"></a>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim had to obey the Accused’s rule of standing still when the accused was angry.

The Accused also informed the victim that she was not to be transferred to her agency and instead would be transferred to India.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the plea of guilty and the post-natal depression of the accused, the Prosecution then proposed a downward adjustment of the sentence to 4 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosecution thereafter submitted that, taking into account the total number of charges, there was psychological harm caused from the pattern of abuse within a short period of time, it would be appropriate for the sentences for the charges MAC 903216-2019 and MAC 903128-2019 to run consecutively, making it a global sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">MITIGATION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence submits that based on the medical history, the Accused should be given a non-custodial sentence or at least for a suitability report for mandatory treatment order to be called for, citing several precedents in support of fines and mandatory treatment order.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Counsel submitted that the accused was remorseful as evidenced by her guilty plea and her cooperation with the police.

The Defence Counsel highlighted that the Accused had suffered depression and anxiety in secondary school which was aggravated after she went through an abortion. She had also suffered sexual abuse at the hand of an adult relative living with her family during her growing up phase.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of more immediate relevance would be the medical opinion of Dr Cheow on her condition at the material time of the offences referred to earlier by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence highlighted, in particular, Dr Cheow’s opinion on the contributory link that the Accused was</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“probably having an episode of postnatal depression at the material time of her alleged offences … there was a causal link between her psychiatric condition and alleged offences as she was in a depressed and frustrated state at the material time”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Counsel also highlighted the clarification report from Dr Cheow who stated that</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“my opinion still remains the same that she was likely to have been suffering from postnatal depression at the material time of the offences, and there was a partial contributory link to her offences as she was in a depressed and irritable state at the material time which affected her ability to exercise self-control.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By “partial contributory link”, I mean that there was a contributory link but only to a somewhat lesser extent.

He urged the Court to call for a mandatory treatment order suitability report. It was submitted that conditions 1 (offender is suffering from a psychiatric disorder which is susceptible to treatment) and 3 ( the psychiatric condition of the offenders is one of the contributing factors for committing the offence) of the criteria set out in section 339(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code have been satisfied.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">THE COURT’S DECISION ON SENTENCE</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentencing principles</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courts have unwaveringly sent out an unequivocal message that physical abuse of domestic maids will not be tolerated by meting out custodial sentences. The rationale for why the principles of <b><em>deterrence and retribution</em></b> take precedence in such cases had been articulated clearly by the Court of Appeal in <em>ADF</em>, which is that</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of domestic maids from abuse by their employers is always a matter of public interest, given their vulnerable status and the prevalence of such relationships in Singapore. No employer or household member has the right to engage in abusive behaviour against a domestic maid. All maids should be treated fairly, with dignity and respect. Indeed, domestic maid abuse not only causes harm to the victim and calls for deep public indignation; it could also harm Singapore’s bilateral relations with other countries. [55]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, unless there are exceptional circumstances, a custodial sentence is almost invariably warranted in cases of domestic maid abuse where there has been any manner of physical abuse.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the sentencing principles</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue in the present case is whether the psychiatric condition of the accused amounted to such an exceptional circumstance justifying a departure from a custodial sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there have been cases where fines have been imposed as well as mandatory treatment orders meted out owing to psychiatric condition of the offender, it is important to ensure that such departure from the norm of custodial sentences should only be made in cases where it can be said that the psychiatric condition is of sufficient severity with significant contributory effect.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere fact that an offender is diagnosed with some sort of psychiatric disorder which has affected the temperament and self-control of the offender cannot by itself be a sufficient factor to grant a non-custodial sentence without looking at the degree and its effect. Otherwise the principle of deterrence will be easily watered down. An offender, if he is still able to realise what he is doing is wrong and is able to make a conscious decision to either stop the action or to continue such actions will need to be held accountable for that conscious decision.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in <em>PP v Kong Peng Yee</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22064-SSP.xml')">[2018] 2 SLR 295</a> cited with approval the following principles in sentencing an offender with a mental disorder falling short of unsoundness of mind (at [59]), from the case of <em>PP v Chong Hou En</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17410-SSP.xml')">[2015] 3 SLR 222</a> at [24]:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_i"></a>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is always a relevant factor in the sentencing process.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_ii"></a>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner and extent of its relevance depend on the circumstances of each case, in particular, the nature and severity of the mental disorder.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_iii"></a>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element of general deterrence may still be accorded full weight in some circumstances, such as where the mental disorder is not serious or is not causally related to the commission of the offence, and the offence is a serious one.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_iv"></a>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the accused person, specific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_v"></a>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder renders deterrence less effective, where for instance the offender has a significantly impaired ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, then rehabilitation may take precedence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_vi"></a>(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though rehabilitation may be a relevant consideration, it does not necessarily dictate a light sentence.

In such an instance, given the public interest consideration of such offences, the principle of general deterrence ought to be given greater emphasis than the principle of rehabilitation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the abovementioned principle (iv), I found that the accused clearly still possessed a conscious choice in committing the offences. In the first incident, the accused was upset over a relatively trivial matter by the victim in not following her instructions of leaving 3 bowls on the shelf. The Accused then took out some bowls from the cupboard and used one bowl to hit her on the head with sufficient force to cause a dent on the bowl.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this incident, the Accused ought to have known what she did was wrong. However, she did not go and get help to deal with her loss of self-control. Instead, she again resorted to use of violence to vent her frustration on the victim over another trivial matter of the victim bathing at a later time. The Accused had the opportunity to cool down as amid scolding the victim, she had to answer a phone call. Despite that, after she ended the call, she proceeded to hit the maid on the head with the cordless handphone.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last incident, over another trivial matter of not putting on the Accused’s son’s pants properly, the accused gave the victim a hard slap on her face causing the victim’s nose to bleed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accused had clearly allowed herself to embark on a pattern of violent behaviour towards the victim over every slightest failure to comply with her instructions without any regard for the feeling of the victim or her well-being. There was no remorse shown over each incident. The Accused was content to show no restraint in using violence on the victim. I also bore in mind that in addition to the three proceeded charges, there were three other TIC charges which involved the slapping of the victim. 2 of the TIC charges resulted in some injury, that of bleeding of the mouth (MAC903129/2019) as well as ringing sound in the ear (MAC 903127/2019).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Cheow had also opined along the same line in that the accused could have chosen to send the victim back if the victim’s performance was so unsatisfactory but she had instead chosen to continue to employ her and continued to hit her repeatedly despite knowing that it was wrong to do so<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the Accused taken immediate remedial action upon losing the temper and lashing out in violent anger the first time, there would be room to exercise more leniency towards the Accused. Unfortunately, both for the Accused and the victim, the Accused did not do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore found that it was clearly inexcusable for the Accused to resort to physical violence in venting her frustration on the victim. Whilst I accept that her postnatal depression had made her more easily irritable and stressed and thus more easily angered when the victim failed to meet her expectations, her mental condition did not cause her to use violence against the victim. It is still within her control as to how she would respond in her anger.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there are case precedents such as those highlighted by Defence, where non-custodial sentences have been imposed such as fines or mandatory treatment orders. Prosecution had also tendered cases where despite the presence of psychiatric conditions, substantial custodial sentences have been imposed. As stated by the See Kee Oon J in <em>Chong Yee Ka</em> at [80] that “no two cases are wholly similar, and sentencing norms, benchmarks and even case precedents do not necessarily always provide a clear guide in sentencing of cases which are highly fact-specific.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further concluded at [82] that,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[u]ltimately, each case must be carefully considered on its factual matrix. The crucial issue is whether the disorder(s) in question can be said to have contributed so significantly to the offending conduct that it diminishes the offender’s capacity to exercise self-control and restraint, and hence reduces her culpability in the circumstances. From the reports of both Dr Koh and Dr Ung, it would appear that notwithstanding their areas of disagreement, they agree that <b><em>there was a substantial diminution in the appellant’s ability to exercise self-control, and there was an impairment of her consciousness in the light of her psychiatric conditions</em></b>. In my judgment, this shows on a balance of probabilities that the appellant’s psychiatric conditions had contributed significantly to her commission of the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing for the 3 offences of violence against domestic maid</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the sentencing ranges laid down in <em>Tay Wee Kiat</em>, for the charge MAC 903216-2019, the harm caused by a slap would clearly fall under the category of less serious psychological and physical harm.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indicative range would be 3-6 months’ imprisonment. Although it was only a slap, nonetheless, the pain it caused would not be insignificant as it was on a sensitive part of the body and it was sufficiently hard to cause the nose to bleed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account another TIC charge which happened on the same day, of a slap resulting in a ringing sound in the ear, I would have imposed a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment. However. given her psychiatric condition had partially contributed to the offence and her plea of guilt, I calibrated the sentence downwards to 2 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calibrating the sentence downwards for this offence as well as for the other 2 offences, I have also taken into account that the Accused, in response to Prosecution’s indication of asking for a compensation order of $5,200 for the loss of salary as well as pain and suffering, had duly made the full payment before sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the offence of hitting the victim with a bowl on her head MAC 903128-2019, given that it was a hard hit on a vulnerable part of the body resulting in dent in the bowl, I would agree with prosecution that this would fall in the higher end of the category of less serious physical and psychological harm. There was further psychological harm caused in this incident as the victim was further scolded by the Accused for turning to the Accused’s husband to request for a transfer to the agency after being hit. The accused also refused the victim’s request for a transfer. This would have the effect of causing the victim a greater sense of helplessness and isolation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account another two TIC charges, which happened around the same time, where the victim was slapped, I would give a slight uplift of upper end of the indicative sentencing range to 7 months’ imprisonment. I then calibrated it downwards to take into account the plea of guilty and the accused’ psychiatric condition at the material time, to 4 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the charge of being hit with a cordless phone, as there was a hard object used to hit the vulnerable part of the body, I would place it on the higher end of the spectrum for the category of low physical and psychological harm. There was similarly a bit of psychological harm caused as the Accused had again denied the victim’s request for a transfer of employer and instead threatened to transfer her to India instead, no doubt causing the victim further distress and sense of helplessness. Furthermore, there was a climate of repression imposed on the victim too in that the Accused had told her that she needed to be still whenever she was being scolded.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore have meted out a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for this offence. Calibrating downwards due to the plea of guilt and her psychiatric condition, I arrived at a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ordering of consecutive sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address the issue of the global sentence. By the operation of section 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 68 Revised Ed 2012, at least 2 of the imprisonment terms would have to run consecutively where three or more terms of imprisonment had been passed at one trial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a>, the High Court had held that the sentencing judge in deciding which sentences are to run consecutively is to consider the one-transaction rule which is to run concurrently for those offences committed in a single transaction. The second principle the sentencing judge should consider is the totality principle which is to ensure that the global sentence should be restrained by the principle of proportionality.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, all the offences were committed on different dates. Although the nature of offences is similar, there are no offences which are committed in a single transaction. Hence, on the first principle, all 3 sentences could be ordered to run consecutively. However, on the second principle, on ground of proportionality, only 2 sentences of imprisonment should be ordered to run consecutively. Applying these two principles, I found that based on the overall culpability of the Accused, where she had committed 6 distinct acts of assault, I had ordered the longest sentence to run consecutively with the shortest sentence, giving a total of 6 months’ imprisonment. In my view, this sentence is not a crushing one and would commensurate with her overall culpability and the harm caused to the victim.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, although the Accused had been diagnosed to be labouring under post-natal depression, the condition as described clearly fell short of the degree where it can be said that there was a substantial diminution in the Accused’s ability to exercise self-control or an impairment of her consciousness. I have thus sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment to take into account the number of offences involved and the need to send out a message that would be sufficient to deter like-minded persons.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>IMH Report dated 2 January 2019 at [3c]</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>IMH report dated 22 June 2018 [18-19])</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>IMH report dated 14 October 2020</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>IMH Report dated 2 January 2019 [3b].</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>IMH Report dated 2 January 2019 [3c].</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>IMH Report dated 2 January 2019 [3c].</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm" action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap4 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner" > <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
