She was represented by counsel who confirmed the same. For ease of reference, the SOF (with the paragraph numbering corrected) is set out as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The accused person is Ng Sue Rong Charis, a 29-year old female Singaporean. She is an engineering assistant and a part-time Grab-food delivery rider.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The victim is Cheong Pek Har, a 72-year old female Singaporean. She was 70 years old on the material day.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>First Information Report</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    On 13 June 2019 at 11.28am, the victim lodged a police report stating that she was hit by an electronic scooter with registration number 946EP (“<b>e-scooter</b>”). The rider of the e-scooter was reported to be the accused person.

There are many pillars and walls around the Void Deck as seen in <b>Image 1</b>. At or about the same time, the victim was walking from the left of the Void Deck towards the lift/staircase landing.</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGMC 0029_Image/[2021] SGMC 0029_image1.png" style="height:213.712611111111pt;width:309.106659722222pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The accused person was riding her e-scooter along a narrow passage of the Void Deck towards the lift/staircase landing as shown in <b>Images 2 and 3</b>. Her view was obstructed by the pillars and walls.</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGMC 0029_Image/[2021] SGMC 0029_image2.png" style="height:385.927173611111pt;width:284.404326388889pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    The accused person did not exercise due care when riding her e-scooter through the Void Deck. The accused person could not apply her brakes on time, and as a result of her negligence, she collided into the victim at a narrow passage near/before the lift/staircase landing. The victim fell to the ground and landed on her left elbow. The victim’s head also hit the floor. The accused person immediately dismounted from the e-scooter and attended to the victim. She gave the victim her name and contact number.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>Victim’s injuries</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    The victim felt pain on her left elbow a few hours later and went to visit Yishun Polyclinic on 10 June 2019. According to the Medical Report dated 26 June 2019 by Dr Yeo Zhi Han, annexed herein as Annex 1, the victim suffered a minor left scalp injury with abrasions noted over her left elbow with some swelling. Further, the victim’s elbow range of movement was limited. The victim was then referred to the Orthopedic Department of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (the “Hospital”).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    On 24 June 2019, according to the Medical Report dated 16 July 2019 by Dr Dominic Cheong Shao Wei of the Hospital, annexed herein as Annex 2, the victim complained of left shoulder, elbow and forearm pain.

The DPP also highlighted, in her oral address, that the speed at which the accused rode her e-scooter was not low especially considering these circumstances. She submitted that the accused ought to have gotten off her e-scooter to walk instead of continuing to ride.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The prosecution then submitted that the harm caused was also moderate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The prosecution came to this assessment in light of the extensive injuries and psychological trauma suffered by the victim coupled with her advanced age. Given the moderate level of culpability and harm, the accused would therefore fall within Category 2 of the framework which indicated a presumptive imprisonment sentence of 1-2 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Finally, the prosecution referred to a number of sentencing precedents (including <em>Tang Ling Lee</em>) where imprisonment sentences of between 5 days and two weeks were imposed for a similar offence. The prosecution concluded that a short custodial sentence was justified in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation Plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Counsel for the accused proffered a written plea in mitigation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> on behalf of the accused which he took the court through in his oral address. In brief, he also made reference to <em>Tang Ling Lee</em> and the framework but disagreed with the prosecution as to category in which the accused ought to be situated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In Counsel’s view, the accused should fall into Category 1 because her culpability and the harm caused were low. Therefore, the accused should only be sentenced to a fine. Counsel stressed that the accused was not speeding. After knocking down the victim, the accused immediately dismounted from her e-scooter and attended to the victim and also gave the victim her contact details.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Counsel emphasised that the injuries suffered by the victim were not serious because the fracture sustained to the radius (large bone of the forearm) was not an open or displaced fracture. The victim went to the polyclinic only the next day and was referred to the hospital for x-rays on 26 June 2019 which revealed the fracture of the radius. She did not undergo any surgeries.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Counsel also highlighted the following ‘mitigating factors’<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     the accused was riding at a low speed of 10-20 km/h;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     the victim did not require hospitalization and was treated more like an outpatient as she only suffered an undisplaced fracture;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     the accused was not riding in a dangerous manner;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     the void deck was not a designated “no-cycling zone”;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     although the accident occurred at about 1.00 pm or lunch time, there is no evidence that the void deck was crowded or would be crowded.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Counsel highlighted that the accused “has a clean record and is well behaved.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The accused has learnt her lesson and will not reoffend. The case has caused pain, suffering, embarrassment and shame to both her mother and her. Counsel provided the accused’s background for the court’s consideration i.e. that she comes from a humble family of low financial means and supports her aged mother who is 60 years old.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> At the time of the offence, she worked part-time as a food delivery rider to supplement her income.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Counsel also mentioned that the accused was only charged in June 2020, a year after the offence. However, he emphasised in his oral address that he was not blaming the prosecution for any perceived delay. He was merely making the point that the accused has not reoffended since the time of the offence until her plea of guilt. Likewise, the prosecution did not make it an issue that the accused pleaded guilty only some ten months (or eight months discounting the ‘circuit-breaker’ duration) after she was charged. For the avoidance of any doubt, I made it clear to Counsel that I would, and did in fact, give the accused full credit for her plea of guilt.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Considerations</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prescribed Punishment</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I start with the punishment for the offence as prescribed in the Penal Code:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>Causing grievous hurt by an act which endangers life or the personal safety of others.</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>338</b>.    Whoever causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    in the case of a rash act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine which may extend to $10,000, or with both; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)     <u>in the case of a negligent act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5000, or with both</u>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> (emphasis added) </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As prescribed above, the present offence involving a negligent act is punishable with either a fine up to $5,000 fine or an imprisonment up to two years or with both punishments. Neither party submitted for a community-based sentence and therefore, I confined my consideration to the sentencing options of a fine or jail sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">General Deterrence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I agree with the learned DPP’s submission that the applicable and predominant sentencing principles are that of general and specific deterrence. I accept that this case called for an adequate sentence to properly reflect both aspects of the deterrence principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The principle of general deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of the offender (see generally <em>PP v Law Aik Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> (“<em>Law Aik Men</em>g”)) at [24]. The High Court in <em>Law Aik Meng</em> provided examples of the categories of situations (be it either the type of offence or the circumstances of the offence) which would engage the principle of general deterrence. I considered that the present offence would fit into at least three of such categories: (i) offences which affect public safety<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>; (ii) where the offence is prevalent<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>; and (iii) offences which involve public disquiet<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. As such, the principle of general deterrence has considerable if not primary prominence in the sentencing consideration for this case. I will elaborate on these categories further.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Public Safety</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly fuelled the boom of online food delivery service but even before the pandemic, the industry was already seeing exponential growth both globally and in Singapore. Thus, it was reported even a year before the present offence that the only food delivery sector in Singapore had grown by almost 30% and was expected to continue to grow annually.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The increase in the demand for food delivery service would mean a concomitant increase in the number of trips made by food delivery employees (such as the accused) to deliver food to customers using various modes of transportation. The risk of injury (and even death) to other road users or members of the public sharing common spaces has consequently also increased. It is therefore incumbent on food delivery persons to navigate public roads and places carefully whilst making deliveries so as not to cause injury to the public who are also sharing the common space. In failing to ride safely, the accused collided into the victim. It is clearly stated in the charge that the accused’s negligence had endangered human life. There can be no question and therefore I agree with prosecution’s submission that the accused’s offence of riding without due care and attention is one which affected public safety.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Prevalence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The accused was riding an e-scooter that comes under a spectrum of active mobility devices governed under the Active Mobility Act 2017 (“AMA”) and the Active Mobility Regulations 2018 (“AMR”) both of which came into force on 1 May 2018. The device in question (an e-scooter) would be termed a motorised “personal mobility device” or “PMD” under s 2 of the AMA. Further, s 24(1) of the AMA empowers the Minister to issue a code of conduct with respect to the use of public paths. Pursuant to this provision, the Code of Conduct for Users of Public Paths 2020 was published on 30 July 2020 (the “Code”) to guide the proper and safe use of active mobility devices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> I note that the present offence pre-dates the Code. Nonetheless, I will make references to the Code in order to fully and appropriately set the conduct of the accused in the proper context when considering her culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Regarding the prevalence of the offence, the prosecution pointed out in its submission that around the material time of the offence, there was a spate of accidents involving riders of PMDs knocking down hapless pedestrians and members of the public.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> This was in fact highlighted by the High Court in <em>Cai Mei Ying v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22806-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 24</a> (“<em>Cai Mei Ying</em>”) at [4]. In <em>Cai Mei Ying</em>, the High Court affirmed the lower court’s sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment imposed on another PMD rider for a similar offence. I shall return to this case below when I consider the sentencing precedents submitted by the prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the wake of the increased and increasing number of accidents involving PMDs up till the time of the present offence, there was much public furore and strident calls to ban such devices from pedestrian walkways and common spaces such as void decks of public housing estates. This thorny issue was also raised and much debated in Parliament. As a result of the public debates, the Town Councils of the PAP constituencies amended their by-laws to prohibit the riding of motorised PMDs at void decks and common areas of their respective public housing estates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The opposition wards followed suit shortly. The prohibition commenced on 1 September 2019 i.e. less than three months after the present offence. The place of the present offence would have fallen within the said prohibition had the incident taken place on or after 1 September 2019. When announcing the ban in a joint statement of the Town Councils, Dr Teo Ho Pin, coordinating chairman of the PAP Town Councils, said<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    …[T]own councils take a serious view on the safety of our residents and PMD users. PMD users seen with reckless riding behaviour or violating the by-laws may face a maximum court fine of S$5,000 upon conviction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Shortly thereafter, the AMR was amended and e-scooters were singled out and specifically banned from plying footpaths from 5 November 2019. Subsequently, the AMR was further amended and the ban was widened to include all manner of powered mobility devices from 3 April 2020.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Presently, PMDs are only permitted to be ridden on cycling paths such as park connectors (PCNs). The following infograph shows where active mobility devices may presently be legally used:</p> <p align="center"><img alt="" longdesc="" src="[2021] SGMC 0029_Image/[2021] SGMC 0029_image3.png" style="height:247.818673611111pt;width:286.837131944444pt;"/></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For the avoidance of doubt, the present offence occurred just before the various prohibitions and regulatory measures took effect. Nonetheless, I considered that at the time of the offence even when PMDs had not yet been banned from footpaths, there was a speed limit of 10 km/h.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The said speed limit had already been reduced from 15 km/h previously. The speed limit continues to apply to bicycles on footpaths. As can be seen, the successive speed limit reduction to even 10 km/h proved insufficient and PMD accidents continued unabated which eventually led to a complete ban from footpaths.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The danger of PMDs was already much debated in Parliament from as early as May 2019 even before the present offence. Thus, Mr Murali Pillai (MP for Bukit Batok) asked the Minister for Transport whether the void deck spaces in HDB housing estates on the ground floor lift lobbies and letter box areas may be designated as pedestrian-only paths to reduce the risk of collision between PMD users and residents in these areas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> He asked the question because he had a real-life example in his constituency where a PMD rider had collided into an elderly lady after she had taken out letters from her letter box, and she had to be warded in hospital. Mr Pillai also pointed out that people who use these areas (i.e. ground floor lift lobbies and letter box areas) “would not be exercising the same caution as crossing roads.” Dr Lee Bee Wah (MP for Nee Soon GRC) also asked the Transport Minister if Singapore could emulate France’s impending ban of PMDs from pavements. Dr Lee said that allowing PMDs on footpaths shifts “more risks to the pedestrians” and added that some of her residents felt so unsafe on footpaths that they have “even given up their daily walks”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As also noted by the prosecution, Dr Lam Pin Min, Senior Minister of State (Ministry of Transport &amp; Ministry of Health) gave a ministerial statement on PMDs in August 2019 and said<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    We are aware that this is a hot topic on the ground. We hear it from our residents; we hear it from many Members of this House. All have expressed concern over the irresponsible use of PMDs, which has caused a lot of trouble. Reckless PMD riders have become a menace on the ground, causing alarm on our public paths. People are worried about whether our elderly parents or young children will be able to avoid speeding PMD users. Speedsters have also illegally modified their devices to travel at very high speed, without fear for their own lives and the danger they put others in…</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In a subsequent session in November 2019 when he was answering multiple questions fielded by various MPs regarding PMDs, Dr Lam informed the House of the escalating gravity of the situation:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    Despite significant efforts, we continue to encounter errant riders who use non-compliant devices and ride dangerously. We catch an average of about 370 offenders per month. The number of accidents involving motorised PMDs continues to rise. There have been more severe accidents and even a fatal one involving a cyclist in September. Many riders have themselves suffered severe injuries, including a few who lost their lives.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     From the foregoing public debates and concerns voiced in Parliament, there can be no question of the prevalence and growing menace of errant PMD riders causing injuries to members of the public</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Public Disquiet</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In respect of public disquiet, the court in <em>Law Aik Meng</em> stated at [25] opined that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    Certain crimes, in addition to harming their immediate victims, also have the wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public. A deterrent sentence is therefore necessary and appropriate to quell public disquiet and the unease engendered by such crimes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30_1"></a>In the case of PMD accidents, as amply illustrated above, it was certainly more than public disquiet. There was public furore and loud calls to ban PMDs and to make errant riders accountable for their negligent or rash riding.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Specific Deterrence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The prosecution did not submit that the principle of specific deterrence was also applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an accused to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition (<em>PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/9601-SSP-M.xml')">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 753</a> at [25] – [29]). In this case, specific deterrence would be less applicable because the offence was neither premeditated nor intentional or wilful. The principle is also inapplicable for reason that the present accused has no record of previous criminal antecedents or previous similar antecedents which might have evinced a pattern of reoffending or escalation of offending.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For completeness, I am also mindful that the application of the principle of deterrence does not necessarily preclude a sentence of a fine (<em>Yang Suan Piau Steven v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0809.xml')">[2013] 1 SLR 809</a> at [34]). However, given the circumstances of the present offence, I was of the firm view that the custodial threshold had been crossed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing Framework</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As noted above, the parties agree that the sentencing framework in <em>Tang Ling Lee</em> applies to the present case. For ease of reference, I set out the framework which prescribes the presumptive sentencing ranges, across three categories of cases, which apply to an accused who claims trial:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="25.5148970205959%"/> <col width="37.8924215156969%"/> <col width="36.5926814637073%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Category</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Circumstances</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Presumptive Sentencing Range</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Fine</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability</p> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">OR</p> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">One to two weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">More than two weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Even though <em>Tang Ling Lee</em> itself was a case which involved a road traffic incident albeit for the same offence under s338(b) of the Penal Code, the said framework was applied in <em>Cai Mei Ying</em> which related to a collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian. The two parameters of the framework are harm and culpability. Harm reflects the nature and gravity of the injury caused to the victim by the accused’s negligent act, and culpability reflects the degree of blameworthiness on the part of the accused in committing the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Culpability</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I agree with the prosecution’s submission that the present accused’s culpability was at least moderate, if not moderately high. I therefore disagree with counsel’s submission that the accused’s culpability was low. I say that for a number of important reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     First, I would strongly disagree with counsel’s submission that the accused was riding at a slow speed. The accused admitted that she was delivering food at the material time and was riding at a speed of 10-20 km/h.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The learned DPP informed that the speed was an estimation made by the accused herself, which was likely to be conservative in her own interest. In other words, the accused may well have ridden at a higher speed than estimated. However, I accept the speed as stated in the SOF which the accused admitted without qualification. Nonetheless, even accepting that range, I considered that the speed was needlessly and dangerously high. As I have noted earlier, even before PMDs were prohibited from footpaths, the speed limit was 10 km/h. Therefore, even if the accused was riding at the lower end of her own estimated range, it would have exceeded the speed limit on a normal pedestrian footpath. Had she been riding near the upper end of the estimated range, she would in fact be riding near or close to double the that speed limit which would have been bordering on dangerous or reckless riding, had the offence taken place on a footpath. Considering the speed limit on a footpath, the accused should at the very least keep within that speed limit when riding her PMD on other public spaces that are shared with pedestrians.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Second, the fact that the incident happened at a void deck and not a footpath augmented her degree of negligence. As stated in the SOF and admitted by the accused, there were multiple blind spots across the entire void deck because of the many pillars and walls thereat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The said pillars and walls may also be plainly seen in the photographs embedded in the SOF at [4]-[5]. The accused further admitted at [5] of the SOF that her view was obstructed by the said pillars and walls. Given these blind spots which would not generally feature on a normal footpath, the accused should have dismounted to push/walk her PMD or at the very least, slowed down to walking pace. In this regard, I had mentioned earlier that a Code was published on 30 July 2020 to guide the proper and safe use of active mobility devices. Paragraph 15 of the Code states:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>Slow down at intersections</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    A rider of a bicycle, PMD or PAB travelling on a footpath or shared path should slow down when approaching intersections of any of these public paths, especially intersections with any bend that limits a rider’s view.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Notwithstanding that the present offence pre-dates the code, I considered that the stated advice is relevant and ought to govern the conduct of every rider including the accused all the time. In the present case, had the accused been riding at a walking pace, she would have been able to stop her PMD and avoid colliding into the victim notwithstanding that the victim may have emerged from a blind spot (as shown in the photograph).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> As rightly pointed out by the DPP, despite the fact that her view was obstructed by the pillars and walls, she chose to ride her PMD across the void deck at the estimated speed which was high, especially given the blind spots. She was therefore unable to brake in time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Third, I also agree with prosecution’s point that there was an increased risk of injury given the higher human traffic that is reasonably expected at the material time of day and the specific area within the void deck. The fact that it was not a crowded area (as in a market in the morning) is beside the point. As revealed in the SOF, the offence occurred during lunch hour at 1.00pm. It also coincided with the usual school dismissal period. Therefore, human traffic would very likely and typically increase during this time in any given public area. What is more poignant is the specific area within the void deck where the collision had occurred. The accused was riding along a narrow passageway passing multiple blind spots when she knocked down the victim at or near the lift/staircase landing and where the letterboxes were located.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As I have mentioned above, this area of the void deck was specifically highlighted by at least one MP during the parliamentary debates as a danger zone. This was because residents who use this area would not be looking out for PMDs and thus would not exercise the same caution as they normally would when crossing roads. Therefore, it was more incumbent on a PMD rider to look out for residents rather than the converse. Incidents of accidents at void decks were also brought to the attention of the house in a collective call to ban PMDs from void decks and footpaths. In summary, given the time of day and this expectedly higher than normal human traffic area, the accused should have exercised additional due care and attention by dismounting to push her PMD or at the very least slow down to walking pace. She abjectly failed to exercise such care and attention.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I further agree with the prosecution that, in light of her advanced age, the victim was particularly vulnerable to such accidents thus increasing the level of accused person’s culpability (<em>PP v BDB</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> at [34]). The elderly victim would not have the agility to avoid PMDs or bicycles coming at her and would be completely defenceless against such accidents. In addition, her advanced age would subject her to a much higher risk of serious or even fatal injuries. The rate of recovery from injuries would also decrease with age.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Finally, I rejected counsel’s submission that the accused’s culpability ought to be considered low because she immediately dismounted from her e-scooter and attended to the victim and that she also gave the victim her contact details. However, I note that s 23 of the AMA prescribes a duty on a driver (which includes a rider of a PMD) to stop, when an accident happens, and to render assistance, give his or her name and address to the injured, and make a police report. This provision and duty is also summarised on the LTA website stating that cyclists and PMD riders should “[s]top, offer help, exchange particulars, and make a police report if you are involved in an accident.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Therefore, what the accused did in the present case after colliding into the victim merely constituted the baseline conduct that the law requires of her in such a situation. Accordingly, there is nothing mitigatory about her conduct post-accident. On the contrary, had she ridden off without stopping, that would have constituted an offence under s 23(3) of the AMA which would have been a culpability-increasing factor to be considered against her. This was an example of an aggravating factor given in <em>Tang Ling Lee</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As a matter of fact, the accused failed to make a police report as she is required under the s 23 of the AMA to do so. This failure also amounted to an offence under s 23(3) of the AMA. Therefore, far from being mitigatory, her conduct after the accident fell short of what is required under the law. Further, she should also have offered to accompany the victim to seek medical attention or at the very least contact the victim’s family members to immediately tend to the victim. That may well have been viewed as a culpability-reducing factor. She also failed to do that.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the final analysis, it was held in <em>Tang Ling Lee</em> that Category 1 of the framework covers cases where culpability-increasing factors would either be absent altogether or present only to a very limited extent. That is certainly not the case here given all the culpability-increasing factors that I have outlined above.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Harm</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In terms of the harm caused to the victim, I disagree with counsel’s categorisation of the injuries sustained by the victim as being minor. She suffered a fracture to her radius which is one of the two large bones of the forearm. I would not make light of a fracture to a significant bone of the human body notwithstanding that it not an open or displaced fracture. In fact, I would be reluctant to downplay any fracture especially if caused to a person who is more than 70 years old such as the victim in this case. As I have noted above, the recovery rate from injuries would decrease with age as was in fact the case here.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It was stressed by counsel, and accepted by the prosecution, that the victim was not hospitalised and did not undergo any surgical procedure. Nevertheless, it was correctly pointed out by the prosecution that the victim continued to suffer pain even three months after the incident which necessitated a further review at the hospital on 13 September 2019. I agree with the prosecution that the victim had clearly not recovered from her injuries and required further medical attention. In any event, as stated in the SOF, the victim did not require any medical leave because she was a retiree. Therefore, the fact that no medical leave or hospitalisation leave was given to her did not, at least in the circumstances of this victim, lessen the severity of her injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I also considered that the fracture to her forearm was not the only injury. She in fact other extensive injuries:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>a.     Partial tear of the mid and posterior portion of the supraspinatus tendon on her left shoulder;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>b.     Left scalp injury as a result of hitting her head;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>c.     Abrasions on her left elbow;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>d.     Swelling; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_e"></a>e.     Left shoulder contusion.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In addition, the victim is unable to lift heavy items after the incident. This is hardly surprising given the partial tear of the tendon of her shoulder. In light of her age, full recovery would be protracted if at all. It is a known medical fact that the healing process of the human body slows down with age. In this case, the victim suffered more than physical injuries. The SOF also stated that the victim has a phobia of e-scooters as she is afraid of getting hit by them again.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> In short, the victim continues to suffer from long term physical impairment and psychological trauma which are caused by the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I further considered that the victim fell and hit her head on the floor. It was indeed fortuitous that she did not suffer any serious head injury. Otherwise, the harm caused would surely cross into the third category of the framework. In summary, I considered that the harm caused to the victim was at least moderate in the context of the framework.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appropriate Category</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In respect of the second category of the framework, the High Court in <em>Tang Ling Lee</em> prescribed that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    Category 2 comprises offences of a higher level of seriousness. These are usually cases <u>where (a) the harm is at the lower end of the spectrum but the culpability of the offender is moderate to high</u>; or (b) the harm is serious but the culpability of the offender remains low. The presumptive sentencing range for cases failing under this category is one to two weeks’ imprisonment. Where there are two or more culpability-increasing factors or injuries of a more serious or permanent nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures, the offence would generally fall into Category 2.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> (emphasis added) </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Even though the harm may not be as serious as that of the precedents which were cited by the prosecution and which are considered below, the accused’s culpability is most certainly moderate to high. In my judgment therefore, the accused fell squarely within Category 2 of the framework.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offender-Specific Factors </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I determined that the accused fell within the Category 2 of the framework which attracts a presumptive sentencing range of 1-2 weeks’ imprisonment. I then considered if there were mitigating factors in favour of the accused which would warrant adjusting the presumptive sentence downwards, or even shift the accused to the lower category. As the framework applies to an offender who claims trial and considering that the accused in the present case had pleaded guilty and is a first offender, I would have to and did calibrate the accused’s sentence below presumptive sentencing range.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Apart from these two mitigating factors, I did not find any other mitigating factors which would justify lowering the presumptive sentence significantly, and certainly not to the extent of only a fine. The fact that she has not reoffended since the offence is neither here nor there. Considering that (i) PMDs have since been banned from all roads and public places (other than cycling paths) and (ii) a slew of regulatory measures have been imposed on the ownership and use of motorised PMDs, including the requirement to register motorised PMDs, would have considerably reduced the opportunity for the accused to reoffend. I was not told if the accused was even riding a PMD anymore after the incident. Many PMD riders have in fact sold or disposed of their PMDs one way or another.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Next, I did not consider her personal and financial circumstances to be of mitigating value. It is trite law that unless these circumstances are exceptional, they do not qualify as mitigating factors. Finally, the pain and suffering caused to the accused by the criminal proceedings surely pale in comparison to the pain and suffering caused by her to the victim. In any event, it is also trite law that any hardship on an accused arising out of the criminal proceedings is par for the course.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Ultimately, the primacy and dominance of the sentencing principle of general deterrence as elaborated above would very much eclipse the mitigating factors favouring the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing Precedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I next considered the sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution. Counsel did not cite any additional precedents but sought to distinguish the precedents tendered by the learned DPP, including the cases of <em>Tang Ling Lee</em> and <em>Cai Mei Ying</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57      <em>Tang Ling Lee</em> was a case involving a collision between a car and a motorcyclist. The driver was sentenced to a week’s imprisonment (with a period disqualification) which sentence was upheld on appeal. The victim suffered multiple fractures to the heel, foot, wrist, fingers and along the spine. He underwent several surgical operations and was in hospital for 69 days followed by 180 days’ hospitalisation leave thereafter. The High Court assessed the driver’s culpability to be moderate to high because she did not bother to check for oncoming traffic and therefore did not see the victim’s motorcycle at all. As regards the injuries, the High Court assessed them to be substantial. Therefore, the driver was held to fall in the lower end of category 3 within the framework.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Her presumptive sentence of more than two weeks’ imprisonment was, however, adjusted downwards in light of the mitigating factors which included her plea of guilt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Cai Mei Ying</em>, the accused was also charged under s 338(b) of the Penal Code for cycling in a market compound where cycling was prohibited. The accused approached a cross-junction where the victim, a 77-year old lady, was walking in a direction perpendicular to the accused’s cycling path. Even though the accused managed to see the victim, she was unable to stop in time and collided with the victim. The victim sustained a hip fracture which required a screw to be fixed. The collision occurred in front of a “No Bicycles” sign. The accused was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In affirming the jail sentence, the High Court held at [4] that the accused fell within Category 2 of the framework. He assessed the accused’s culpability to be moderate because she knowingly cycled in a narrow and confined area that prohibited cycling. In addition, Aedit Abdullah J forewarned at [7] that “I would strongly urge those on bicycles and PMDs to exercise such due care and consideration; where injuries do arise because of the fault of the rider, it is likely that the courts will take a stern view and impose custodial sentences, which may be higher than what has been imposed in this case.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In comparison with the present case, the prosecution submitted that even though the void deck was not as crowded as a market, nevertheless, due to the many blind spots, the specific area of the void deck and the time of day, the present accused was just as culpable as the offender in <em>Cai Mei Ying</em>. I fully agree with this submission. However, the prosecution did concede that the harm caused in the present case was less than that in <em>Cai Mei Ying</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The prosecution also referred to two other unreported cases where the lower court imposed a custodial sentence of 5 days’ imprisonment for the same offence under s 338(b) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The first of the two unreported cases is <em>PP v Yin Yanmin<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></em> where the accused was riding a bicycle on a pavement next to a HDB block. He tried to overtake the victim from behind but collided into the right side of the victim. He was unable to apply his brakes in time to avoid the collision. He then dismounted and attended to the victim and gave his name and contact number (much like what the accused did in the present case). The victim underwent open reduction and internal fixation of her right radius. She was warded for five days and given hospitalisation leave of 105 days. The accused person was sentenced to 5 days’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the second unreported case of <em>PP v Neo Wei Chia</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>, the accused was riding an e-scooter speedily on a park connector. The 6-year old victim suddenly crossed into the path of the accused’s e-scooter. The accused could not brake in time and collided into the back of the victim. Both victim and accused suffered injuries. The victim was given 14 days’ hospitalisation leave and fully recovered within a month from the injuries, which included superficial abrasions, lacerations and a left temporal bone fracture with moderate left conductive hearing loss.
