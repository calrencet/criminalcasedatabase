District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused person is Iswandi Bin Yahya, male 37 years old. At the relevant time, he was working as a cleaner, holding the position of cleaning team leader.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       He pleaded guilty to the following charge that –</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “… sometime on or about 15 August 2014, in Singapore, did cheat the Malayan Banking Berhad, Singapore Branch (“the bank”), to wit, by deceiving the bank into believing that you intend to comply with the conditions stated in the Letter of Offer dated 15 August 2014, in relation to the home loan facility for the property located at 1 Woodgrove Walk Singapore 738144, a fact which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the bank into approving and delivering a home loan of $2,840,000 to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition)”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Sometime in March 2015, the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) was alerted to six police reports lodged by representatives of various banks between November 2014 and February 2015, including the Malayan Banking Berhad (“Maybank”). These reports stated that forged income documents had been submitted to the banks in support of mortgage loan applications to finance the purchase of four landed private properties. One of the properties was at 1 Woodgrove Walk, Singapore 738144 (“the Woodgrove property”). On 3 October 2014, a loan of $2,840,000 was disbursed in reliance of the documents provided by the supposed buyer, Iswandi.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Prior to Iswandi’s involvement, one Bijabahadur Rai s/o Shree Kantrai (“Bijabahadur”), had proposed a “cashback scheme” to one Sufandi Bin Ahmad (“Sufandi”). The scheme was as follows –</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     To inflate the stated sale price of the Woodgrove property on the conveyancing documents, including the Option-to-purchase (“OTP”). Under the then prevailing regulations of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, a buyer could only obtain a mortgage loan of up to 80% of the stated sale price. The sellers were typically told that the purpose of inflating the sale price on the conveyancing documents was for the buyer to maximise the mortgage loan that could be obtained from the buyer’s bank. Typically, when banks valued properties before giving mortgage loans, they would have a valuation range; and the banks were willing to extend 80% of the price agreed between the buyer and seller, or 80% of the maximum price at which they had valued their property, whichever was lower. The stated sale price was inflated to be close to the bank’s maximum valuation of the property.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     To perform the “cashback’ of the excess payment the seller received from the buyer’s bank upon completion, as a result of the inflated sale price.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Sometime in 2014, Sufandi learnt that the owners of the Woodgrove property were looking to sell it. He approached Iswandi and proposed to list Iswandi as the buyer. Iswandi would apply for a mortgage loan in his name to purchase the Woodgrove property. Iswandi was told that he would be paid $5,000 for his part.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Iswandi agreed to the proposal. He knew that he did not have the financial means to purchase or finance the Woodgrove property.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Separately, Sufandi learnt that one Mohamed Haron bin Hassan (“Haron”) and Juma’at bin Johari (“Juma’at”) were property agents who were facilitating the sale of the Woodgrove property on behalf of the owners, Mohamad Hamzi bin Rabu (“Hamzi”) and his wife. Sufandi also learnt that Hamzi intended to sell the Woodgrove property at the price of $2,400,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Through Haron and Juma’at, Sufandi arranged with Hamzi to agree to sell the Woodgrove property for $2,400,000 but to state an inflated sale price of $3,550,000 on the conveyancing documents. Hamzi, Haron and Juma’at all knew that the purpose of stating an inflated sale price on the conveyancing documents was to enable Iswandi to obtain a larger loan from the bank.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The illustration of the “cashback” aspect of the scheme for the Woodgrove property was as follows –</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_"></a>·    Actual sale price: $2,400,000</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2__1"></a>·    Inflated sale price: $3,550,000</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a> <u>Before completion of sale</u> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2__2"></a>·    Seller receives 1% of actual sale price ie 1% of $2,400,00 = $24,000.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a> <u>Upon completion of sale</u> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2__3"></a>·    Seller received 80% of the inflated sale price from the buyer’s bank ie 80% of $3,550,000 = $2,840,000.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2__4"></a>·    “Cashback” to be returned:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>$2,840,000 - $2,400,000 = $464,000.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2__5"></a>·    Actual amount received by the seller:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>$24,000 + $2,840,000 - $464,000 = $2,400,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Pursuant to an arrangement between Sufandi and Bijabahadur, Sufandi obtained the following documents –</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     A forged Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore Notice of Assessment dated 23 May 2014 under Iswandi’s name (“the forged NOA”). This document falsely stated that Iswandi had an annual income of $471,600 in 2013; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     A forged Central Provident Fund Board (“CPF Board”) history statement dated 5 August 2014 in Iswandi’s name (“the forged CPF statement”). This document falsely stated that Iswandi received CPF contributions from his purported employer, Option Vests Pte Ltd.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Sufandi and Bijabahadur knew that these documents were forged. Sufandi knew that Iswandi did not earning $471,000 in 2013. The documents were sent to Maybank to deceive Maybank into believing that Iswandi had an annual income of $471,000 in 2013, and thereby dishonestly induced Maybank into disbursing a mortgage loan of $2,840,000 to Iswandi to fund the purchase of the Woodgrove property.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Sufandi later obtained from Haron an OTP that was signed by the owners of the Woodgrove property. Iswandi then signed on the OTP. Sufandi also created the email address, XXX.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 6 August 2014, Sufandi forwarded the forged documents mentioned in [10], via the email address to the Financing Solutions Manager of Maybank, Ammar Salim bin Ariff (“Ammar”), in support of the application for a mortgage loan to purchase 1 Woodgrove Walk. Maybank was deceived into believing that Iswandi has an annual income of $471,600 in 2013, a fact which was not true. Maybank then gave their in-principle approval for the mortgage loan of up to $3,600,000 to be disbursed to Iswandi. Sufandi later informed Ammar that the sellers of 1 Woodgrove Walk was willing to sell the property at $3,550,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Ammar then arrange to meet Iswandi to explain the Letter of Offer to him. At the meeting, Ammar verified Iswandi’s identity and explained the Letter of Offer to him. Iswandi then signed the Letter of Offer. Ammar arranged for a courier to deliver a MAS Factsheet to Iswandi’s residential address, which was signed by Iswandi.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Prior to the completion of the sale of 1 Woodgrove Walk, Bijabahadur passed $101,100 in cash to Sufandi to pay for the stamp duty for the transaction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Completion of the sale of the property took place on 3 October 2014. A transfer instrument was executed by the transferors, Hamzi and his wife, in favour of Iswandi. The transfer instrument transferred the title to 1 Woodgrove Walk in favour of Iswandi for a consideration of $3,550,000. It was registered on 19 November 2014. Iswandi executed a mortgage instrument as mortgagor and Maybank as mortgagee. It gave Maybank a mortgage over the property as security for the loan it disbursed to Iswandi. It was also registered on 19 November 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Maybank then approved and disbursed a mortgage loan of $2,840,000 to Iswandi. Iswandi later defaulted on the mortgage loan repayments. Maybank exercised its security over the property and sold it for $1,618,000, thereby suffering a loss of $1,212,332.35.

The victim in this case was a financial institution. Large scale deception on financial institutions here would affect the country’s integrity and reputation as a financial hub. The monetary loss caused directly was very high. In this case, Maybank was cheated into disbursing $2,840,000, and only recovered 57.3% of the amount. The loss suffered by Maybank was $1,212,332.35. The financial burden perpetrated by such mortgage loan fraud offences would fall on the shoulders of the public in the form of higher administrative costs, more onerous application processes, and ultimately higher interest rates.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The cashback scheme offence was carefully planned and premeditated</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Although Iswandi was not the mastermind, he was a willing and active participant and was instrumental in the success of the scheme. For a reward of $5,000, he had agreed to be the dummy buyer of the property. He was fully aware that he had no financial means to purchase the said property, apply for the mortgage loan, and service the repayments. He had signed all the relevant documents and interacted with the bank staff. He had also attended at the conveyancing solicitors’ office to sign the completion documents where these documents were explained to him.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Case precedents relied on by prosecution</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     DPP Gwee submitted that the prosecution’s sentencing position at [21] was consistent with the following case precedents -</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)      <em><u>PP v Terence Tan Teow Boo </u></em> <u>(DAC 27672/12 &amp; Ors)(“</u> <em><u>Terence Tan</u></em> <u>”)</u>: The offender who was a sales manager, had used fictitious documents to deceive his company’s procurement department into believing that customers had placed orders for goods. Relying on these non-existent orders, the procurement department prepared the goods for delivery. The accused person collected the goods and sold them for personal gain. He pleaded guilty to 10 s 420 charges and 80 similar charges were taken into consideration (“TIC”). The amount involved was $1.129 million. The offences spanned over four years. No restitution was made. He was a first offender. The individual sentences imposed ranged between 15 to 30 months’ imprisonment.

He had deceived DBS bank into disbursing a loan of $1.54 million (the proceeded charge). The amount involved in the TIC charge was $1.94 million. The total loss suffered by DBS was $676,320.

The district court noted that the offender had not demonstrated remorse. She was sentenced to 78 months’ imprisonment (39 months’ imprisonment on each charge, and both sentences to run consecutively).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In particular, DPP Gwee highlighted the cases of <em>Terence Tan</em> and <em>Jaslyn Chen</em> because the loss occasioned in these cases were similar to that in the present case. In these two cases, imprisonment sentences of 75 months and 81 months were meted out. However, one distinguishing factor was the fact that the offenders in the two cases were the main perpetrators of the frauds. As such, DPP Gwee had calibrated the sentence downwards to 36 months, to reflect the difference in the role played by Iswandi.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mitigation plea/defence sentencing submission</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Ms Goh Qian Hui, for the defence, set out Iswandi’s personal circumstances. He worked as a cleaner to support his large family comprising his wife and eight young children aged from 11 months to 17 years old. He also provided financial support to his father who was bed-ridden because of a stroke. These obligations exerted great financial and emotional stress on him. When he committed the present offence, he had just been released from the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) and had just begun working as a delivery attendant with a monthly salary of $1,200. He had succumbed to temptation when he was approached by Sufandi with the promise of $5,000. Notwithstanding Ms Goh underlined Iswandi’s extreme remorse for his wrongful actions. She emphasised that he did not get the $5,000 that was promised to him. It was also never the intention of the perpetrators of the fraud that he was to derive any financial benefit from the amount cheated from Maybank. For these reasons, he had not actually derived any personal benefit from the fraudulent scheme.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On sentence, Ms Goh applied the harm-culpability framework crafted by the District Court in <em>PP v Gene Chong Soon Hui</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21682-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 117</a> (“<em>Gene Chong Soon Hui</em>”). It was adapted from the framework for s 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act (Chapter 33A, Revised Edition 2007) formulated in <em>Logachev Vladislav v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21303-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 12</a>.

Her reasons were set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Gene Chong Soon Hui</em>, the harm caused was categorised as moderate when the economic loss suffered was $3,193,737.65. In another case, <em>PP v Ng Kheng Wah and others</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23834-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 249</a> (“<em>Ng Kheng Wah</em>”), the court held that the loss of $130 million in that case put the harm in the moderate to high range. However, as full restitution was made and there was no evidence of actual loss, the court adjusted the harm level to that of the highest end of the “slight harm” range. Ms Goh therefore submitted that the harm caused in the present case fell into the less than moderate range, even after factoring the non-economic harm caused ie the impact on Singapore’s integrity as a financial hub (see [22]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On culpability, Ms Goh submitted that Iswandi’s culpability was low. The economic loss suffered was $1,618,000. However, she emphasised that it was never intended by the perpetrators of the scheme that Iswandi should benefit from the amount. He was only promised a payment of $5,000 for his involvement. This amount was wholly independent of the scheme and the mortgage loan disbursed. Further, Iswandi did not receive the said amount. As such, Ms Goh argued that the economic loss suffered was not an accurate proxy for Iswandi’s culpability. She relied on <em>Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22879-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 42</a> (“<em>Gan Chai Bee Anne</em>”) in support. In <em>Gan Chai Bee Anne</em>, Chief Justice Menon had held that for financial and property offences, as a general principle, the greater economic value involved, the heavier the sentence. The economic value referred to the economic harm suffered by the victim, and not other forms of intangible harm such as harm suffered by society at large if the offence had the effect of infringing a public interest. Where an offender was not intended to benefit from what the victim had been caused to part with, the value of the victim’s economic loss would not be an accurate proxy for that offender’s culpability. For these reasons, Ms Goh submitted that Iswandi culpability was low.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The prescribed punishments</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The offence under s 420 Penal Code carried an imprisonment sentence of up to 10 years. In addition, the offender shall also be liable to a fine.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The general principle in sentencing financial and property offences was set out in <em>Gan Chai Bee Anne</em>. The general principle was already succinctly set out at [30].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     To determine the appropriate sentence warranted on the facts of the present case, I applied the harm-culpability matrix based on the sentencing framework in <em>Gene Chong Soon Hui</em>. DPP Gwee has rightly pointed out that the sentencing framework has not been specifically endorsed by the High Court. However, I noted that the High Court had upheld the district court’s sentence in that case, and the district court had applied the framework in sentencing the offender. As such I was of the view that the framework would serve as a useful marker in calibrating the appropriate sentence for the case before me.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In arriving at his sentencing proposal of at least 36 months’ imprisonment, DPP Gwee had relied on <em>Terence Tan</em> and <em>Jaslyn Chen</em> as these cases involved similar factual circumstances and more importantly, similar amounts of around $1.2 million (see [24]). Sentences of 75 months’ and 81 months’ imprisonment were meted out respectively. DPP Gwee had then calibrated these sentences downwards to 36 months’ imprisonment to reflect the fact that Iswandi was not the main perpetrator, unlike the accused persons in <em>Terence Tan</em> and <em>Jaslyn Chen</em>. DPP Gwee also submitted that the defence sentencing submission of six months’ imprisonment was severely inadequate given that the loss suffered by Maybank was significant, and there was a need for deterrence given the public interest involved.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the other hand, Ms Goh’s proposed sentence of six months’ imprisonment was based on the argument that Iswandi was never intended to benefit from the amount $1,212,332.35. Applying the dicta in <em>Gan Chai Bee Anne</em>, his culpability should not be pegged to that amount. In addition, he had not derived any benefit at all given that he did not receive the $5,000 that was promised to him. In addition, Ms Goh cited some case precedents as well to support her arguments. I noted that these case precedents involved charges under s 417 Penal Code, a different and less serious offence and which did not prescribe a mandatory imprisonment sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On culpability, both parties agreed that Iswandi’s culpability was low. He was not the mastermind. His role was that of a “dummy buyer”. He was not involved in the negotiation of the actual sale price and the preparation of the forged documents that were submitted to Maybank. But his role was not entirely passive and peripheral, in that he had not just lent his name to the scheme and nothing more. He had done more than just that. He had interacted with the staff of Maybank in signing the requisite financial documents. He had also interacted with the conveyancing solicitors at their office to sign the completion documents. In the context of a sale and purchase of property transaction, these interactions were integral to the success of the scheme. Therefore, without Iswandi, the scheme would have failed. As such, I found that Iswandi’s culpability fell on the upper end of low culpability. The fact that it was never intended that he would benefit from the amount defrauded, and that he had not even received the $5,000 which was promised, had been taken into consideration.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On harm, two factors came into focus. First, the victim of the deception was a financial institution ie Maybank. I agreed with DPP Gwee’s submission that large scale deceptions like that in the present case, would affect Singapore’s integrity and reputation as a financial hub. The financial burden arising from mortgage fraud offences, though initially borne by the banking industry, would ultimately be passed down to the public in the form of higher administrative costs, more onerous application processes and higher interest rates. Second, given the high prices of property in Singapore, the frauds would invariably involve significantly high amounts. This was aptly illustrated by the present case, where the loan amount disbursed was $2,840,000, and the economic loss suffered was $1,212,332.35. Therefore, I agreed with DPP Gwee’s submission that the harm inflicted was high. In the context of the <em>Gene Chong Soon Hui</em> framework, it fell into the severe harm category; to be precise, taking guidance from the case precedents cited, at the lower end of the range.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Ms Goh’s reliance on <em>Gan Chai Bee Anne</em> was misplaced. I noted that the learned Chief Justice Menon had made the factual finding that the appellant had not participated in the dishonest scheme for profit. Rather, he found that she had participated in the scheme simply to build a good business relationship with Nike. CJ Menon found that as the appellant had done business with Nike since 2006, there was no need for her to curry any further favours from it. I found the factual finding significant because this distinguished <em>Gan Chai Bee Anne</em> from the present case. Iswandi had participated in the fraudulent scheme purely for profit. His motive was to get the $5,000 because of his dire financial situation. His action had also directly contributed to the loss suffered by Maybank. In this context, when calibrating the level of harm, the amount to consider must be $1,212,332.35.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defence proposed sentence was also clearly manifestly inadequate when one compared that sentence with the sentences meted out in motor insurance fraud cases. These cases involved the making of false claims against insurance companies for non-existent personal injuries and property damages in relation to fictitious motor vehicle accidents or where motor vehicle accidents were staged. Persons who pretended to be the drivers and/or passengers (known as phantom drivers/phantom passengers) of these motor vehicles would then make claims against the motor insurance companies for personal injuries and property damages. The factual matrix motor insurances fraud cases bore similarities to the present case. They involved deception on financial institutions namely the insurance companies. The deception adversely affected the delivery of financial services by these insurance companies ie, the provision and underwriting of motor insurance. This affected a large segment of the public by causing a rise in motor insurance premiums as underwriting losses were in no small part due to inflated and fraudulent claims.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     A sampling of these cases was set out below. The offenders in these cases were charged under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. They had pleaded guilty and were first offenders or had dissimilar antecedents –</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)      <em><u>PP v Yoe Henry </u></em> <u>(DAC 47216/13)</u>: The offender provided the mastermind his car and his particulars as the phantom driver. A false claim for property damage of $18,787 was made. The claim was paid out. No restitution was made. The offender benefited from the free repair done on his car. He was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)      <em><u>PP v Rosli Bin Ahmed </u></em> <u>(DAC 91447/15 &amp; anor)</u>: The offender acted as the phantom driver and made a false property damage claim for $7,200.35.

The insurance company paid out $1,500. No restitution was made. He was sentenced to 11 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_e"></a>(e)      <em><u>PP v Mohammad Azdi Bin Sudi </u></em> <u>(DAC 928433/14)</u>: The offender acted as a phantom passenger and made a false personal injury claim for $2,885.10. The claim was paid out. No restitution was made. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_f"></a>(f)      <em><u>PP v Liew Kok Hon Godfrey </u></em> <u>(DAC 928423/14 &amp; 2 ors)</u>: The offender acted as the phantom driver and made false claims for personal injury and property damage. The insurance company paid out $1,400. No restitution was made. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_g"></a>(g)      <em><u>PP v Lim Wee Khuan </u></em> <u>(DAC 928427/14 &amp; 3 ors)</u>: The offender acted as a phantom passenger and made a false personal injury claim for $5,289.92. The claim was paid out. Full restitution was made. He was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_h"></a>(h)      <em><u>PP v Lim Chiew Beng </u></em> <u>(DAC 928419/14)</u>: The offender acted as a phantom passenger and made a false personal injury claim for $7,898.85. The claim was paid out. Full restitution was made. He was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It could be seen that the sentences imposed for the offenders, who had played a lesser role as phantom driver/phantom passenger, hovered around five and six months’ imprisonment. Significantly, the amounts involved were substantially much smaller than that in Iswandi’s case. And in all instances, except for one, full restitution were made. Therefore, the defence’s contention that six months’ imprisonment was the appropriate sentence was way off the mark.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In conclusion, Iswandi fell into the lower end of the severe harm category and the upper end of the low culpability of the framework in <em>Gene Chong Soon Hui</em>. Using the framework as a marker, and having regard to the case precedents cited above, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence was 24 months’ imprisonment. In arriving at my decision, I have considered that he had pleaded guilty. As for his antecedents, I did not attach any weight to them as they were dissimilar.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Iswandi has lodged an appeal against the sentence. He is currently on bail pending the outcome of the appeal.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap5 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
