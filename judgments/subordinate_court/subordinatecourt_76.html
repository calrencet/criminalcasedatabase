id="p1_1"></a>1       The Accused is Sa’adiah Binte Jamari. She was 35 years old at the time of the alleged offences. She was convicted after a trial on two charges – both for offences under Section 328 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for administering poisons to two babies – one was 5 months old and the other was 11 months old. The Accused was babysitting each one of them in her home at different times.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The two babies will be referred to as “BB1” (5-month-old baby) and “BB2” (11-month-old baby). BB1 was in the care of the Accused in the daytime on 8 separate occasions from 7 November to 9 December 2016 and BB2 was only with the Accused on the night of 25 December till the next morning of 26 December 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Accused was sentenced to three and a half years of imprisonment for each offence that she had committed. The two periods of imprisonment were ordered to run consecutively, giving a sentence of seven years’ imprisonment. The Accused has filed an appeal against the convictions and the sentence. A stay of execution on the sentence was granted pending the appeal. She is presently on bail.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The two charges preferred against the Accused were:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>DAC 940948/2018</b>,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You, SA’ADIAH BINTE JAMARI, are charged that you, sometime in the period from 7 November 2016 to 9 December 2016 at or near Block 446 Hougang Avenue 8 #XXX, Singapore, did administer to one [name redacted], certain poisons, <em>namely</em>,</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a)    Alprazolam</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)    Chlorpheniramine</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c)    (Dextro)methorphan</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">d)    Diazepam</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">e)    Orphenadrine</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">f)    Oxazepam</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">g)    (Pseudo)ephedrine</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">h)    Temazepam</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">i)    Triprolidine</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">j)    Zolpidem</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    with intent to cause hurt to the said [name redacted], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 328 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>DAC 940949/2018</b>,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You, SA’ADIAH BINTE JAMARI, are charged that you, sometime in the period from 25 December 2016 to 26 December 2016 at or near Block 446 Hougang Avenue 8 #XXX, Singapore, did administer to one [name redacted], certain poisons, <em>namely</em>,</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a)    Alprazolam</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)    Chlorpheniramine</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c)    Diazepam</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">d)    Ephedrine</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">e)    Oxazepam</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">f)    Temazepam</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    with intent to cause hurt to the said [name redacted], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 328 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Undisputed Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       An Agreed Statement of Facts was submitted jointly by the Prosecution and the Defence at the start of the trial. The Agreed Statement of Facts dated 19 February 2020 contained the following undisputed material facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Accused was residing at [address redacted] (“the Accused’s home”) at the material time with her two teenage daughters. The Accused has a diploma in Nursing and has been enrolled as a nurse with the Singapore Nursing Board since 2002. She was a freelance nurse and received jobs from hospitals in Singapore. At the material time, she was also providing babysitting services at her home. She had advertised her babysitting services on the Internet sometime in 2016, stating in the advertisement that she was a nurse.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts in relation to BB1</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sometime in October 2016, the mother of BB1 was looking for babysitting services for her children and was contacted by the Accused in this regard. She started sending over BB1 and her elder daughter of 5 years old, to the Accused's home for babysitting sometime in early November 2016. Generally, she would send the children over at around 7.30am and pick them up around 6pm in the evening. She arranged for these babysitting services with the Accused through WhatsApp messages. The Accused babysat both BB1 and her older sister on eight occasions in November and December 2016 – 7, 8, 18, 21 November and 5, 7, 8 and 9 December 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Accused was the primary caregiver to BB1 during these times, and would feed her, settle her down for naps, change her diapers and bring her out for walks together with her teenage daughters.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Accused personally prepared BB1’s milk, save for one occasion where her daughter prepared the milk for BB1. It is agreed that on that occasion, the daughter did not add any poisons or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drugs to the milk. It is also agreed that the Accused's daughters did not administer any poisons or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drugs to BB1 throughout all the babysitting sessions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 22 November 2016, BB1 was brought by her mother to KK Women's and Children's Hospital ("KKH") for a check-up as the mother had noticed that BB1 was not of her usual behaviour. KKH took a blood sample from BB1 and subsequently discharged BB1 as nothing unusual was found. The blood test did not check for any medications or drugs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 9 December 2016, after picking BB1 up from the Accused's home, the mother of BB1 noticed that BB1 was unnaturally drowsy. She brought BB1 to Parkway East Hospital, where BB1 was admitted from 9 to 13 December 2016. According to the medical memo dated 16 February 2017 by Dr Low Eu Hong ("Dr Low"), BB1 was found to be drowsy, floppy and unable to follow objects. Checks revealed that BB1 had low blood glucose with elevated drug levels. In relation to the drug levels, BB1's blood sample was taken on the day of admission on 9 December 2016 and sent to the Health Sciences Authority ("HSA") for analysis on 12 December 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     BB1 was given medical treatment and responded well. She was discharged on 13 December 2016. She was reviewed at the clinic on 17 December 2016 and found to be well.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     HSA issued a toxicology report dated 21 December 2016 (Lab No. TX-1631-07575) stating that on analysis of the sample of BB1's blood, the following substances were detected:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>a.     Alprazolam- 0.37ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>b.     Chlorpheniramine- 0.14ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>c.     (Dextro)methorphan - 0 .19ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>d.     Diazepam - 0.28ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>e.     Nordiazepam - 0.90ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_f"></a>f.     Orphenadrine - 0.1 Oug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_g"></a>g.     Oxazepam- 0.13ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_h"></a>h.     (Pseudo)ephedrine - 2.3ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_i"></a>i.     Temazepam - 0.1 Oug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_j"></a>j.     Triprolidine- 0.05ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_k"></a>k.     Zolpidem - 0.96ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts in relation to BB2</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Sometime in December 2016, the mother of BB2 posted in a Facebook group called "Mummy's Group" that she needed someone to look after BB2 on the night of 25 December 2016. The Accused responded to this message and it was agreed that BB2 would be sent to the Accused's home for babysitting.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On the night of 25 December 2016, BB2 was sent to the Accused's home by her mother. The Accused told BB2’s mother that she was a nurse. Other than the Accused and her two daughters, Dr Peter Looi ("Dr Looi") was also present in the Accused's home that night. Dr Looi was not involved in the care of BB2. The Accused's daughters did not at any time administer any poisons or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drugs to her.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 26 December 2016, sometime between 6.30am and 7.20am, the father of BB2 picked her up from the Accused's home. At around 5pm on the same day, BB2 was sent to KKH by her mother. She was observed to be drowsy with ptosis (droopy eyelids), truncal ataxia (inability to sit upright and/or stand without support), and had difficulty walking, and was admitted at KKH.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A urine sample was taken from BB2 on 28 December 2016. This was submitted to the HSA for analysis the next day. On analysis, the following substances were detected in the urine sample: hydroxyalprazolam, alprazolam, chlorpheniramine, diazepam, ephedrine, nordiazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     A blood sample was taken from BB2 on 29 December 2016. This was submitted to the HSA for analysis on the same day. On analysis, the following substances were detected:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>a.     Diazepam - 0.33ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>b.     Nordiazepam – 1.3ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>c.     Oxazepam - 0 .17ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>d.     Temazepam - 0.08ug/ml</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_d"></a>BB2 responded well to physiotherapy and was discharged on 1 January 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other Agreed Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 29 December 2016, the following items were found by the police in the Accused's home:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>a.     One empty slab of Zolpidem (trade name Stilnox).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>b.     One slab of Chlorpheniramine (trade name Piriton) with ten tablets.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>c.     A handkerchief with brown stains, on which Diazepam was detected after testing.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>d.     A "<em>Kidsper Nanny</em>" milk bottle, on which Zolpidem was detected after testing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In November and December 2016, the Accused was prescribed, among other things, Stilnox (Zolpidem), Xanax (Alprazolam) and Diazepam by Everhealth Medical Centre.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The following items are available over the counter at retail pharmacies:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>a.     (Pseudo)ephedrine and/or Ephedrine;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>b.     (Dextro)methorphan; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>c.     Tripolidine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Nordiazepam, Oxazepam and Temazepam are metabolites of Diazepam. Hydroxyalprazolam is a metabolite of Alprazolam.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Prosecution acknowledged that there is no direct evidence of the Accused administering the poisons to the babies. There is also no confession by the Accused to the commission of the two offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Based on the agreed facts and the evidence adduced at trial, the DPP submitted that the Accused was the person who had administered the poisons to the babies based on the forensic evidence:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)      <em>Time for the drugs to take effect</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>Dr Low, BB1’s doctor, testified that upon administration, the drugs would take effect in the child fairly quickly, “within a couple of hours” and may last “6 to 8 hours” depending on the dosage of the drugs and the duration for which it was taken. If the dose was not excessive, the cough and cold mixtures would subside after 6–8 hours.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)      <em>Time for the drugs to appear in the body</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The drugs would generally first be detectable in the blood before being detected in the urine. Mr Andreas, the HSA expert, testified that the time taken for the absorption was “quite fast” and estimated it at one or two days, before being metabolised and excreted out from the body.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)      <em>Types of side effects</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The reported side effects, mainly drowsiness and sedation. Dr Low also testified that young children would be less able to handle the side effects as compared to adults. It would also affect the mood and behaviour of the child.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The DPP submitted that such evidence corroborated the accounts of the parents and other family members of the babies that they had observed such effects only after picking up the babies from the Accused’s home. These symptoms – of the effects of the drugs found in the babies – were not observed prior to that. Therefore, the only reasonable inference is that the drugs had been administered when they were at the Accused’s home, when the babies were in the care of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The DPP submitted that the Accused’s lies corroborated her guilt. The Accused’s statements, her filed defence and her testimony in court were riddled with contradictions and outright lies. The Prosecution urged the Court to find that her lies corroborate her guilt, and to convict her of the two charges accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the Reply to the Defence’s Closing Submissions, the DPP reiterated that the Prosecution had not relied on similar fact evidence to establish the guilt of the Accused. A joinder of charges for trial is a separate matter from reliance on similar fact evidence to prove the charges. The Prosecution had led evidence in the course of the trial which was sufficient to establish the guilt of the Accused for each charge on its own.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Defence’s position against the charges was that the Accused had not administered any poisons and she did not know why these allegations have been made against her. The Defence accepted the fact that certain poisons were detected in the blood and urine samples of the two babies at the material time. The Defence was not challenging the forensic evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Defence Counsel submitted that the case against the Accused must fail because the Prosecution cannot establish the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no evidence as to how, when and where the poisons were administered. There is no confession to the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Accused also disputed the evidence of the victims’ mothers that their babies were normal when they arrived at the Accused’s home and were unusually drowsy when they left the Accused’s home.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sole Issue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Based on the agreed facts and the respective closing submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence, the only issue in this case is:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “<em>In the absence of direct evidence, whether the circumstantial evidence adduced is sufficient to draw the irresistible inference that the Accused had poisoned the babies?</em>”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Prosecution had indicated that it was not relying on any similar fact evidence for this case. That meant that the evidence adduced in respect of the circumstances for the poisons found in each baby is to be considered separately. There is to be no linkages to be drawn between the two cases of poisoning beyond the fact that a single investigation was carried out for the two cases.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The findings of any trial court must necessarily depend on the issues raised in the trial and be appreciated in context. The context depends very much on how the evidence was adduced and how the respective cases were presented.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The sole issue was whether the circumstantial evidence adduced in this case led only to one conclusion – that the Accused had administered the poisons found in the two babies.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Since similar fact evidence is not a line pursued by the Prosecution in this case, the evidence in this case must be considered separately for BB1 and BB2. There might be some overlap in the evidence adduced due to the common investigations carried out in respect of the same Accused but the analysis of the evidence in respect of the poisoning of these two babies had to be kept distinct.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Poisoning of BB1</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The poisons found in the blood of BB1 were discovered after samples of her blood was obtained on 12 December 2016 at Parkway East Hospital. BB1 was brought to the hospital on 9 December 2016 after the last babysitting session at the Accused’s home. The mother of BB1 had noticed that she was very drowsy after picking her up from the Accused’s home. The doctor at the hospital examined BB1 and found that she was drowsy, floppy and unable to follow objects. BB1 was admitted in the hospital until 13 December 2016.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The poisons in BB1 is connected to the Accused primarily because of the timing of the symptoms and the fact that all eleven of the specific drugs found in the blood of BB1 could be traced to similar drugs that the Accused had taken or been prescribed as her medication. This is the key reason for why the Accused was the primary suspect for the poisoning of BB1.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I was satisfied from the circumstances that no one else except the Accused had administered the poisons found in BB1. My finding that only the Accused had poisoned BB1 are based on the following analysis of the evidence:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     BB1 was a 5-month-old baby and could not have ingested any of the drugs found in her blood. Therefore, only another person or other persons could have administered the poisons found in her. The people who could have fed BB1 at the material time were her mother, her maternal grandmother, her paternal aunt, her paternal grandmother, the Accused, Dr Looi, the daughters of the Accused and the 5-year-old sister of BB1. The list of people who could have fed BB1 could arguably be longer, but the type of drugs and the number of drugs found in the blood of BB1 necessarily limited the search for possible suspects to persons who might have access to these drugs at the relevant point of time.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     Bearing in mind the point in time of the discovery of the drugs in the blood of BB1 (as specified in the charge) and the forensic scientific evidence, the relevant and material period of time for our consideration ought to be around 9 December 2016 when BB1 was admitted to Parkway East Hospital (“PEH”). It is only fair to place our focus around this date since there is no evidence that BB1 was poisoned on any other dates even though she was brought to KKH on 22 November 2016. On that occasion, the blood sample taken from BB1 was not tested for medication or drugs. Therefore, any observations of BB1 around 22 November 2016 and any attempts to attribute a cause to those observations would be speculative at best and prejudicial to the Accused at worst. The cart should not be put before the horse.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     The list of potential suspects was reduced in the agreed facts by both the Prosecution and the Defence. It was agreed that Dr Looi (PW18) and the daughters of the Accused had not administered the poisons found in BB1. The daughters of the Accused were possible suspects because they lived with the Accused when she babysat BB1 and they could have access to the drugs that the Accused had taken or were prescribed. Therefore, the remaining suspects were the mother, the grandmothers, the paternal aunt of BB1 and the Accused. The maternal grandmother (PW2) of BB1 and her paternal aunt (PW3) both testified that they did not feed BB1 medication. Their testimonies were not challenged in the cross-examination by the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     The paternal grandmother (PW14) became a potential suspect when it was revealed that she was working as a senior assistant nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital at the material time. She testified that she did not feed BB1 medication. She also testified that she was not a registered nurse and therefore she did not have any access to medication at the hospital. Her role at the hospital is to assist doctors and nurses in providing nursing care and she is not allowed to give medicine to patients. She was on long-term medication for diabetes, hypertension and was also given heart medicine. She was never prescribed sleeping pills.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_e"></a>(e)     PW14 was cross-examined on her relationship with her daughter-in-law <em>i.e</em>. the mother of BB1. It was suggested to PW14 that she was not on good terms with her daughter-in-law. PW14 agreed that there was some tension between them at the material time as she preferred her granddaughters at home instead of being sent to a babysitter. The counsel suggested that she was angry with her daughter-in-law for not listening to her not to send BB1 to the babysitter. She disagreed. Counsel then suggested that she was so angry she had fed BB1 with small amounts of drugs. PW14 disagreed with that suggestion.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_f"></a>(f)     Counsel also asked if PW14 was familiar with the list of drugs found in the blood of BB1. PW14 said that she knows of the drug Diazepam but she was not familiar with the rest of the drugs. She disagreed with the counsel’s suggestion that she could have access to the drugs that was found in BB1. The gist of the cross-examination of PW14 was to suggest that she was so unhappy with the daughter-in-law for going against her advice of not sending BB1 to the babysitter that PW14 could have poisoned her granddaughter.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_g"></a>(g)     After a close examination of this suggestion of the defence counsel, I was satisfied that it was a baseless accusation against PW14. PW14 came across as an honest witness. She did not deny that she was not supportive of the decision of her daughter-in-law to send BB1 to a babysitter. However, she understood that it was a decision that belonged to her daughter-in-law. The suggestion by the counsel was easy to make against PW14 but there was no evidential basis for it. There was nothing produced by the Defence to cast any doubt on the testimony of PW14 that she did not have access to the drugs found in BB1 and that she did not poison her granddaughter. I accepted PW14’s evidence and rejected the suggestion by the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_h"></a>(h)     With that, we are left with either the mother of BB1 or the Accused who had administered the drugs. There was no suggestion by the Defence that the mother of BB1 had poisoned her. In any event, it was a suggestion that would not have any legs to stand. There is no evidence to indicate that the mother of BB1 had any reason to poison her baby.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_i"></a>(i)     Furthermore, the actions taken by the mother of BB1 was consistent with the behaviour of a concerned mother who sought medical attention for her daughter when something was wrong with her. First, when she noticed BB1 to be unwell, she brought BB1 to KKH for a check up on 22 November 2016, the morning after picking up BB1 from the Accused’s home after a babysitting session the day before. Next, she sent BB1 to Parkway East Hospital on 9 December 2016 immediately after seeing BB1 in a very drowsy state. The contemporaneous communications between the mother of BB1 and the Accused also showed that the symptoms of crankiness and drowsiness exhibited by BB1 appeared during the times the Accused was babysitting BB1.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_j"></a>(j)     On the other hand, as mentioned earlier, the material time period to be considered is the day of 9 December 2016. The symptoms observed of BB1 being under the influence of medication or drugs which were found in her blood were right after BB1 was picked up from the Accused’s home, where BB1 had stayed for the past 10 hours. The scientific evidence, as adduced from the Prosecution witnesses – Dr Low and Mr Andreas, the expert from HSA – pointed to the drugs having been administered within those 10 hours.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_k"></a>(k)     Finally, the indisputable evidence adduced in the course of the trial was that the Accused was found to have consumed, at least on one occasion, all of the drugs found in the blood of BB1 and had been prescribed some of the drugs found in BB1. Another significant piece of evidence is that the police had found the drug Zolpidem inside a plastic milk bottle at the Accused’s home during a search. The explanation by the Accused for this piece of evidence will be dealt with when her defence is being considered subsequently. The Accused had also admitted in her police statement that she had on one occasion fed Chlorpheniramine to BB1. This will also be dealt with later when the evidence of the Accused is analysed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_l"></a>(l)     These pieces of evidence, taken individually, do not suffice to prove that the Accused had committed the heinous act against BB1. However, when all the pieces of evidence are put together, there is an irresistible inference that no one else but the Accused had done it.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_m"></a>(m)     All said, one of the most compelling reason for coming to the conclusion that it was the Accused who had poisoned BB1 is the fact that all 10 drugs found (note that some were metabolites) in the blood of BB1 coincided with the different drugs that the Accused had consumed before and had access to.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I agree with the Prosecution’s submissions that the strength of the circumstantial evidence is such that an irresistible inference could be drawn on the fact in issue: <em>Vinit Sopon and others v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 1071.xml')">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 1071</a> at [52] that the Accused had administered the poisons to BB1.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Poisoning of BB2</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     BB2 was only in the care of the Accused for one night from 25 December 2016 to the morning of 26 December 2016. At around 5.00 pm of 26 December 2016, BB2 was sent to KKH after her mother found her to be drowsy with droopy eyelids, being unable to sit upright without support and had difficulty walking. The poisons (as listed in the charge) were found in the bodily system of BB2 after the samples of her urine and blood were obtained on 28 and 29 December 2016 respectively at KKH.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The symptoms and behaviour of BB2 was consistent with the presence of the drugs found in her body. Dr Koh Ai Ling opined that an overdose of Alprazolam and Diazepam (which are benzodiazepines) could lead to sleepiness and drowsiness, impaired coordination and diminished reflexes. These symptoms were seen in BB2 after she was picked up from the Accused’s home. Dr Koh also testified that an overdose of Chlorpheniramine could lead to drowsiness and fatigue and these were also observed in BB2.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     BB2’s change in behaviour before and after the babysitting session can only be explained by the drugs found in BB2. The presence of these drugs in BB2 could have been administered to her during the babysitting session. Since it had been agreed as a matter of fact that Dr Looi and the two daughters of the Accused did not administer the drugs to BB2, it was only the Accused who could have fed the drugs to BB2 when she was at the Accused’s home.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Defence suggested that the poisons could have been fed to BB2 by her parents. I found no basis for the suggestion. The Defence highlighted that the father of BB2 had suffered depression previously and had taken anti-depression medication. Beyond that, there was nothing to show either he or the mother of BB2 could have poisoned the baby. It was a fanciful suggestion.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     By reason of the symptoms displayed by BB2 after she was picked up from the Accused’s home and the discovery of the poisons in her urine and blood samples soon after she had been admitted to the hospital, in the absence of any other reasonable inference to provide a reasonable doubt, the conclusion is that it was the Accused who had fed the poisons to BB2. The Accused had recent access to those specific drugs found in BB2’s urine and blood samples and the opportunity to administer them to her. Going by the agreed facts (which excluded the other members in the household of the Accused) and based on the scientific evidence of the effects of those drugs found in BB2 and the timing of the display of the symptoms exhibited by BB2, the irresistible inference is that the Accused was the culprit.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for rejecting the denials of the Accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Accused elected to testify after she was called upon to enter her Defence to both charges. The Accused was not a credible witness. The Accused was impeached by the DPP based on the previous inconsistent statements that she had given to the police. There were material inconsistencies as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     In court, the Accused stated that she was only familiar with the drugs Alprazolam and Zolpidem. She also said that she had never taken Diazepam from the start of 2016 to the time of her testimony. However, she admitted in her police statements that she had been taking Alprazolam and Diazepine in 2016 and she was familiar with and had access to the drugs Dextromethorphan, Triprolidine, Ephedrine, Orphenadrine, Zolpidem, Chlorpheniramine, Alprazolam and Diazepam.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused was regularly prescribed Alprazolam and Diazepam in 2016 and her medical records showed that she was prescribed these two drugs at least once a week from October to December 2016. The Accused was also prescribed Zolpidem almost every time she was prescribed Alprazolam and Diazepam.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     In court, the Accused denied feeding medication to BB1 but in her police statements to two different police investigators recording her statements on two different occasions, she admitted that she had given BB1 the medication Piriton (the trade name for Chlorpheniramine) on the instructions of the mother of BB1. The Accused could not explain the inconsistencies. BB1’s mother confirmed that she had not asked the Accused to feed her daughter medication. This was not challenged by the counsel for the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On the police finding a milk bottle in the Accused’s home which had traces of Zolpidem in it, the Accused explained that on the last occasion she babysat BB1, she was unable to find BB1’s milk bottle and had sent her daughter down to buy a new one. When her daughter came back, the Accused had already messaged the mother of BB1 and found BB1’s milk bottle. Nevertheless, the Accused decided to pour BB1’s milk into the new bottle so as not to disappoint her daughter. The Accused testified that she had only used this milk bottle bought by her daughter once and once only. This explanation of the Accused was no explanation for how traces of the drug Zolpidem came to be found inside the milk bottle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As an afterthought, the Accused tried during her re-examination to provide an explanation of how the milk bottle bought by her daughter could have been stained with Zolpidem. After much difficulty on the part of her counsel to understand what she was trying to say, it was clear that she was struggling to come up with a coherent account of how the bottle was found with traces of Zolpidem. She came up with an incredible explanation that she needed to go to the toilet urgently and therefore decided to put her medicine inside the milk bottle. She added that she wanted to keep her medicine away from her daughters by storing it in the milk bottle. This was never brought up by the Accused in her police statements or in Court during her examination-in-chief.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     After listening to the whole of the evidence given by the Accused, I was satisfied that the Accused was unreliable as a witness and sought at every turn to distance herself from the poisons found in the bodies of the two babies. These attempts were futile in the light of the medical records. The Accused credibility was also seriously undermined by her lies on material aspects of the case, such as her retracted admissions in her statements that she had fed Chlorpheniramine to BB1, and her incredible and belated explanation for the traces of Zolpidem found in the milk bottle. I rejected her evidence that she had not administered the poisons found in BB1 and BB2.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     There was also other evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the Defence in the course of the trial which in my view were strictly not material to the sole issue to be determined in this case. For example, whether BB1 was cranky and teething when she was sent to the Accused’s home and whether BB2 had suffered bruises at the Accused’s home or not. The Defence also tendered evidence to show that the Accused loved the babies and would not harm them. These matters were rather subjective and peripheral to the issue at hand and were not capable of proving one way or the other the guilt or innocence of the Accused. I have found it unnecessary to make a finding on them to arrive at my verdict.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submissions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The DPP tendered a table of sentencing precedents for cases of poisoning. The DPP submitted that deterrence was the operative sentencing principle in this case. From the precedent cases and based on the harm caused and the culpability of the offender, the appropriate global sentence is about 8½ years. The sentence for each offence ought to run consecutively given that the two offences were committed against two different victims on two separate occasions. The Prosecution suggested a downward adjustment to a total sentence of at least 7 years on account of the totality principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The DPP pointed out that the two offences were serious offences carrying mandatory sentences of imprisonment. In this case, the Accused was entrusted to care for two infants as a babysitter. The law recognises the need to protect vulnerable persons such as the elderly and young children. Offences against such persons ought to be dealt with severely by the courts.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Defence sought for a global sentence of not more than two years. The Defence Counsel submitted that the Accused was a first offender as she did not have any criminal record. Counsel cited other mitigating factors <em>inter alia</em> the contribution of the Accused to society as a nurse, that the drugs had no serious or lasting effects on the babies, and her mental condition.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Punishment for the offence</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>Section 328</em> of the Penal Code:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">Whoever administers to, or causes to be taken by, any person any poison or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drug or other thing, with intent to cause hurt to such person, or with intent to commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52_1"></a>The offence under Section 328 of the Penal Code shall be punished with up to 10 years imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Accused was sentenced to a sentence of 42 month’s imprisonment for each offence. The two sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run consecutively giving a total sentence of 84 months or 7 years of imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for the sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Deterrence and retribution are the dominant sentencing principles in this case. Since the offence under s328 Penal Code is to be punished with up to 10 years of imprisonment, it is obvious that this offence is a very grave one and a sentence of a considerable length is warranted per charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The actual length of the custodial sentence would depend on several factors. The sentencing of an offender for poisoning a person would involve the following factors. The first would be the harm or potential harm to the victim. This would depend on the potency or deleterious effect of the substance on the victim. The second would be the type of victim. For example, the age of the victim is a highly relevant factor. The very young or the elderly are most vulnerable as they are usually dependent on caregivers and they would have to trust the caregivers to help and not harm them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the sentencing in this case, the key factors considered were:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_"></a>·    The tender age of the two victims who were only five months and eleven months old. The two victims were helpless babies wholly dependent on the Accused while they were in her care. They completely lack the capacity to sense danger or detect and respond to hazardous situations. They were totally at the mercy of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2__2"></a>·    The nature of the drugs administered in this case had put the lives of the young victims at risk.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2__3"></a>·    The high level of trust reposed in the Accused by the mothers.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2__4"></a>·    A deterrent sentence was necessary to show that such injurious acts are reprehensible and must be met with appropriately significant punishments.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2__5"></a>·    Retribution is a relevant sentencing principle as physical harm was caused to both babies and psychological and emotional harm were caused to their mothers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I agree with the Prosecution’s submissions that the applicable sentences are in the range of three to four years of imprisonment per charge, based on the sentencing precedents tendered in court. The two offences were committed on two separate and distinct occasions and against two different victims. Therefore, they ought to run consecutively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The DPP had suggested a sentence of imprisonment of at least 4½ years for the offence committed against BB1 and a sentence of at least 4 years for poisoning BB2. The difference being accounted for by the fewer drugs detected in BB2 than in BB1. The DPP had also adjusted the suggested sentences downwards on account of the totality principle. The Prosecution therefore submitted for at least 3 years and 8 months for the first charge and at least 3 years and 4 months for the second charge, giving a total sentence of at least 7 years of imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I came to the same total sentence of imprisonment of 7 years but not by the same calibration. I calibrated the individual sentence for each offence to be 42 months or 3½ years. I did not find it necessary to distinguish between the two offences based on the number of drugs found in each of the babies as the gravamen of the two offences were the same. Based on the evidence adduced, the different number of drugs did not result in more harm for one baby or the other. Thankfully, both the babies recovered well and did not appear to suffer any long-term effects of the poisoning. They suffered temporary infirmities.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Although BB1 was in the care of the Accused on eight occasions, it is important to bear in mind that the Accused had been convicted for poisoning BB1 only in relation to one occasion. It would not be fair or right to impose punishment on her for the possibility of the Accused poisoning BB1 on the other occasions, however strong the suspicions might be. Punishment can only be meted out for convicted or admitted offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As for the Totality Principle in sentencing, I did not find it to be highly relevant in the present case. The total sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment for poisoning two infants cannot be said to be crushing although the Accused is a first offender. The offences were intentional acts and committed by a person who was a nurse who knew the nature of the drugs being fed to the infants. The overall sentence, though substantial, was not disproportionate to her criminality. It was said in the case of <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a> at [47] that the totality principle is one of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions. The totality principle is generally to be applied at the end of the sentencing process, and it requires the sentencing judge to take a last look at all the facts and circumstances and be satisfied that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Accused is a divorced mother of two teenage daughters. The Accused maintained that she had not committed the offences. As there was no remorse and no cooperation with the investigative agencies, no sentencing discount could be given. In a belated submission of mitigation by the defence counsel, an attempt was made to seek a lower sentence for the Accused in view of her psychiatric disorders. This was a non-starter as no causal links have been shown or established between these disorders and the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It was stated at paragraph 12 of the Closing Submissions of the Defence that: “The persons who poisoned the babies committed a heinous act against two defenceless young human beings who could neither run away from the harm nor tell an adult who could then keep them safe from the perpetrator. The persons who poisoned the babies deserve to be punished to the full extent of the law.” It is a statement which aptly described the abhorrent nature of the offences.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap10 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
