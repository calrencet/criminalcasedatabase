guilty to and was convicted of the following charge:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“….you between 14 March 2019 and 5 August 2019, in Singapore, being employed in the capacity of a servant to wit, a senior accountant by QNet Private Limited (“the company”), and in such capacity being entrusted with a certain property, to wit, 23 cheques belonging to the company and withdrawing a total of SGD223,500 from the company’s Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited bank account by using the said 23 cheques, did commit criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition), which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to Section 124 (4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2012 Revised Edition), which is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years and shall also be liable to fine.”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The statement of facts which the AP had admitted without qualification stated as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“1.    The accused is Ong Jun Hao, a 35-year-old Singaporean male bearing NRIC No. SXXXXXXE. At the material time of the offences, the accused was employed by Qnet Pte Ltd (“the company”) as a senior accountant.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The complainant is Quek Xue Lin Sharon, a Singaporean female who is the director and owner of the company.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<u>A</u>)     <u>First Information Report</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    On 30 October 2019 at about 4.53pm, the complainant lodged a police report at Central Division Headquarters against the accused, stating that he had encashed 23 cash cheques which had been pre-signed by her between March and August 2019 without the company’s knowledge and authorisation, and misappropriated the total sum of S$223,500 belonging to the company.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<u>B</u>)     <u>Facts surrounding the offences</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Since around July 2018, the accused worked as an accounts executive for the company. When the previous senior accountant left the company, the accused was promoted to become the senior accountant. As the senior accountant, the accused was tasked with managing the company’s accounts and finances. As part of his job scope, the accused was entrusted with usage of the company’s cheques to make payments to third parties for the company. The complainant and the accused were the only two authorised signatories of the company’s OCBC bank account no. XXX (“the bank account”). Both their signatures were required before a cash cheque from the bank account could be encashed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    As the complainant frequently travelled for business, she would sign several empty cash cheques beforehand and give them to the accused. The accused knew that these company cheques were entrusted to him for payments relating to the company’s business transactions with other third parties, including vendors and suppliers.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    From March 2019 to August 2019, on 23 occasions, the accused counter-signed on the empty cash cheques already pre-signed by the complainant, filled in an amount and encashed them at a branch of OCBC bank without the complainant’s knowledge or approval, as detailed below:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1">

Shortly thereafter on 6 August 2019, the AP sent a WhatsApp message to the complainant admitting he had taken money from the company’s bank account without her approval, and that he had lost all the money through gambling. This led to the discovery of the offences by the company.

I agreed with the prosecution that it would only be a matter of time before the AP ’s offences were discovered as the AP knew that unless he continued to deposit more monies into the bank account, there would be insufficient funds to pay the staff due to his misappropriation. What the AP did on 22 July 2019 was to avoid detection, and thereby delay the discovery of his offences. It appears clear that unless the AP had the means to continue to deposit more money into the account, it was a matter of time before his offences would come to light. Hence, any mitigating weight given to the voluntary confession should be minimal as it was only a matter of time before his offences were discovered<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and the mitigating weight of the AP’s admission of the offences must be confined to allowing for the discovery of the offences at the particular point in time that they were discovered.

My reasons as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     As stated in paragraphs 6 to 8 above, there is no mitigating value in the AP’s voluntary surrender and early plea of guilt in the aforesaid circumstances where the prosecution would have no difficulty in proving the charge against him. In this regard, the defence may wish to note that a criminal who has been caught red handed but still refused to admit to the crime and disrupt investigations by the authorities thereby wasting precious State resources is a factor which a court can take into account in enhancing a sentence as the conduct of an accused during trial can legitimately be taken into consideration in passing sentence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Australian case from Victoria of <em>Connor Sharman v The Queen <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?results=200;query=au/cases/vic/VSCA/2017/241.html')">[2017] VSCA 241</a></em> held that even in relation to crimes known to the investigators, an offender has a right to a “significant discount” where by his admissions, he provides proof of an offence which the prosecution could not otherwise have established. As pointed out in the prosecution submissions, the offender in this Australian case had admitted to details beyond the statements of the complainant for a charge of committing an indecent act with a child under the age of 16. The provision of this further information provided by him rendered the offence more serious.3 For the second charge of committing an indecent act with a child under the age of 16, it was the offender’s confession which provided the basis for the particularisation of the charge as the complainant, who was seven at the time, refused to make a statement or participate in a Video Audio Recording of Evidence. This meant that the offender, through his confessions, provided proof of two offences which the prosecution could not otherwise have established. This case is clearly distinguishable from the present case where the AP’s early plea of guilt was made in circumstances where the prosecution would have no difficulty in proving the charge against him, as explained in paragraphs 6 to 8 above.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Australian case from New South Wales of <em>Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85</em> where a combined sentencing discount of 50% from what would otherwise have been an appropriate sentence was granted to the accused in light of the mitigating factors of voluntary surrender and guilty plea is also distinguishable. There was a statutory provision in section 23 of the New South Wales Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999 which empowers a sentencing judge to grant a sentencing discount and ensure that a sentence would not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence has no statutory equivalent in Singapore. In this Australian case, the victim was killed by the offender on 18 September 2008 but the death and the offender’s involvement only came to light when the offender confessed on 12 November 2010. The Australian court applied the <em>Ellis</em> discount (arising from <em>R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603</em>), which it elaborated on the degree of leniency to be shown for the disclosure of unknown offences, which varied according to (1) the likelihood that the offences would have been discovered by the authorities and (2) the likelihood that the offences could have been proven beyond reasonable doubt in a court without the disclosure. In this regard, I accepted the prosecution submission that there is no basis in the present case to apply the substantial sentencing discount of the sort given in <em>Panetta v R</em> as while the misappropriation was not suspected by the company before the AP’s confession, it was a likely or inevitable outcome, as opposed to one which was unlikely in the extreme to be detected. Further, there are no issues with proof due to the availability of evidence from other sources in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Court of Appeal in <em>Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20331-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGCA 37</a> at [71]</em> had expressly endorsed a sentencing discount of as much as one-quarter to a third of what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence, but specifically observed that whether, and if so, what discount should be accorded to an accused who pleaded guilty was a fact-sensitive matter that depended on multiple factors. <b>While a voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilt by him in court are factors that can be taken into account in mitigation</b> as they may be evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept punishment for his wrongdoing, a plea of guilt can be of no mitigating value, for example, when the evidence overwhelmingly supports a conviction. In cases that were especially grave and heinous, the sentencing considerations of retribution, general deterrence and the protection of the public would inevitably assume great importance and cannot be significantly displaced merely because the accused had decided to plead guilty. It is impossible to be prescriptive about this exercise and the discretion is one which must be exercised by the sentencing court, acting judiciously in the light of the aforesaid principles and based on the fundamental principle of sentencing that the punishment imposed must fit both the crime and the offender.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_e"></a>(e)     In my view, based on the aforesaid legal principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal, voluntary surrender is not an additional mitigating factor over and above a plea of guilt so as to warrant a discount beyond a third, as contended by the defence. Hence, even if this Court were to accept the defence submission that the prosecution had failed to prove that the AP had no choice but to surrender as there is nothing in the Statement of Facts to support the prosecution’s aforesaid position, the AP’s voluntary surrender would not entitle him to a sentencing discount beyond a third which can be granted to him for his plea of guilt. As submitted by the prosecution, the defence recognised that a voluntary surrender and a guilty plea are evidence of remorse, and conceded that both should be considered together and a single discount applied to avoid double-counting. Hence, the AP’s voluntary admission to his employer is merely a facet of his contrition, alongside his plea of guilt, and should not be given substantial mitigating weight additionally.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_f"></a>(f)     As was also held by the High Court in <em>PP v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21209-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 707</a> at [91]</em>, in the context of sentencing benchmarks and tariffs, the circumstances of each case are of paramount importance in determining the appropriate sentence. Sentencing is neither a science nor an administrative exercise. Sentences cannot be determined with mathematical certainty. Nor should they be arbitrary. The sentence must fit the crime. Every sentence reflects a complex amalgam of numerous and various factors and imponderables and requires the very careful evaluation of matters such as public interest, the nature and circumstances of the offence and the identity of the offender. Most crucially, it calls for the embodiment of individualised justice. This in turn warrants the application of sound discretion. I agreed with the prosecution that the aforesaid principles apply with equal force in the context of a sentencing discount. Prescribing a fixed percentage to the sentencing discount to be accorded for an offender’s confession and plea of guilt would unduly fetter the court’s sentencing discretion as the nature of each offender’s confession and its effect and importance in each case is different.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_g"></a>(g)     As conceded by the defence, there is no local case where the court expressly stated that a 50% discount can be given for a voluntary surrender and plea of guilt. In my view, the case of <em>PP v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram and other appeals and another matter <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21209-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 707</a></em> does not support the defence submission that a discount of 50% can be granted in an appropriate case. In this regard, I accepted the prosecution submission that this court is not bound by the two Australian authorities cited by the defence and in any event, they can be distinguished as explained above. Further, the sentencing discount accorded to each case, on account of the mitigating weight of a confession and plea of guilt, cannot be cast in stone and is fact sensitive.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_h"></a>(h)     I note that none of the accused in the cases cited in the defence submissions had been given a 50% sentencing discount as explained below:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_h-p3_i"></a>(i)        <em>PP v Peter Khoo Chong Meng <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0453.xml')">[2012] SGDC 453</a> (at [21] of the report)</em> where the accused was given a high global fine of $100,000 i/d 20 weeks imprisonment plus a penalty of $83,500 in default 16 weeks’ imprisonment) due to many factors, including voluntary surrender, as follows: (I) his unreserved plea of guilt; (2) his genuine remorse as demonstrated by his apology to his family, to his employer, SPH, to his friends, and to his God; (3) the fact of his voluntary confession that led to his crimes being exposed on himself; (4) the full co-operation and assistance he had rendered to the authorities from the outset; (5) his full preparedness to, and his actual making of, complete restitution to SPH the moment the amount was confirmed and before he was even questioned by the Police; (6) the fact that no one has suffered any loss in respect of any of the offences (including the charges taken into consideration) as full restitution had been made to SPH even before the AP was charged; (7) the fact that his services were terminated from SPH and he had thereby lost all his pension and other benefits including his share options worth $120,000;(8) his good character; (9) his contributions to society, especially needy children; and (10) his continued contributions even after his confession in September 2010.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_h-p3_ii"></a>(ii)        <em>PP v Siew Boon Loong <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0611.xml')">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 611</a></em> where significant weight was placed on the AP’s voluntary surrender to the police as he was not in a position where there was no other way out, but to surrender.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_9-p2_h-p3_i_1"></a>(i)       As submitted by the prosecution, there is a difference between surrendering to the authorities and coming clean to an employer. The implications differ. The AP in the present case did not voluntarily surrender to the police, but confessed the offences to his employer. The weight to be accorded to the AP’s voluntary admission must differ from the offenders’ voluntary surrender to the police.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">SENTENCING PRECEDENTS</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Of all the sentencing precedents cited by both parties, I am of the view the most relevant precedent with similar facts is the case of <em>PP v Tan Kiang Chua Destry <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/54656-M.xml')">[2007] SGDC 294</a></em> where the accused was the Vice-President of Marketing at a company when he misappropriated $234,364.59 which was collected from customers of his company. The money was used to settle the accused’s gambling debts. The accused pleaded guilty, had no antecedents and made full restitution and was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment, although he did not appear to have taken any steps to avoid detection of the offences as pointed out by the prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I am unable to accept the defence submission that the sentencing precedent of 24 months in <em>PP v Tan Kiang Chua Destry</em> should be given a further discount in view of the AP’s voluntary surrender for the reasons given in paragraphs 6 to 8 above. Further, there is no sentencing precedent to take into account inflation over the years in terms of the amount misappropriated in the present case so as to reduce the sentence accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I accepted the defence submission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> that the rest of the cases cited in the prosecution’s Table of Sentencing Precedents are distinguishable from the present case, either in terms of the number of charges, the total amount misappropriated, no antecedents, no or partial restitution, or claim trial, and hence, they should not be applied to the present case. Further, I note that 2 precedents of <em>PP v Teng Lai Soon and PP v Wan Kam Lan (unreported) DAC-920285-2018</em> cited by the prosecution were unreported cases for which I had to bear in mind what the High Court in <em>Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0707.xml')">[2010] 1 SLR 707</a></em> had cautioned against relying on unreported decisions indiscriminately in determining the appropriate sentence for the particular case before the court since the detailed facts and circumstances of these cases were hardly disclosed or documented with sufficient clarity to enable any intelligent comparison to be made, and comparisons based on unreported decisions are difficult and are likely to be misleading because a proper appraisal of the particular facts and circumstances is simply lacking.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In conclusion, having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the present case and having considered the sentencing factors, principles and precedents as mentioned above, I am of the view that a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment was the appropriate sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Accordingly, I sentenced the AP to 24 months’ imprisonment in DAC 909604 of 2020. In my view, the sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but wholly appropriate and commensurate with the nature and extent of the AP’s culpability and was a sufficient deterrent sentence tempered with proportionality without the effect of a crushing sentence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>See <em>PP v Peter Khoo Chong Meng <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0453.xml')">[2012] SGDC 453</a> at [7]-[8]</em> citing the Australian case of R v Ellis (1986) NSWLR 603 and Kow Keng Siong, “Sentencing Principles in Singapore” (2009, Academy Publishing) at page 568, [20.056])</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>See PP v Siew Boon Loong [2005] 1 SLR(R) 0611 at [15] and per R v Ellis at 604.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>See <em>Tan Kay Beng v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0010.xml')">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 10</a> at [36].</em></p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>See <em>PP v Tan Kiang Chua Destry <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/54656-M.xml')">[2007] SGDC 294</a> at [14]</em> where the District Court reduced the sentence from 36 months to 24 months (effectively a one-third discount) due to the full restitution made.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>See <em>Pittis Stavros v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17406-SSP.xml')">[2015] 3 SLR 181</a> at [68].</em></p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>See <em>PP v Tan Fook Sum <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/1315-M.xml')">[1999] SGHC 80</a> at 33.</em></p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>See <em>PP v Tan Fook Sum <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/1315-M.xml')">[1999] SGHC 80</a> at 33</em></p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>See <em>PP v Fernando Payagala <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0334.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 334</a> at [42]</em> and <em>PP v Law Aik Meng <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> at [25(d)]</em></p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>See the cases cited by the defence of <em>Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1990] 2 SLR(R) 0361.xml')">[1990] 2 SLR(R) 361</a></em>; <em>PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1993] 3 SLR(R) 0369.xml')">[1993] 3 SLR(R) 369</a></em>; <em>PP v Teo Heng Chye <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1989] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')">[1989] 1 SLR(R) 680</a>; and Sim Gek Yong v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1995] 1 SLR(R) 0185.xml')">[1995] 1 SLR(R) 185</a></em> where little weight was given to each of the accused’s voluntary surrender as each accused was in a sense caught red-handed or has no means of escape for reasons as stated in each case.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>See <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, Third Edition, Volume 1 at pp 145-146.</em></p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>See paragraphs 37 to 40 of defence submissions.
