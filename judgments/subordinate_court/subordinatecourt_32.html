A search was conducted in the unit and a grey pouch containing several sachets of drugs was seized from underneath a bed mattress on the second level of the chalet unit where the Accused was.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     When opened, the grey pouch<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (“A1”), was found to contain four blue packets which in turn contained different sizes of sachets with crystalline substance in it.

No interpretable DNA could be obtained from the swabs taken from the other exhibits found in the grey pouch.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     DNA analyst PW10 Ong Yao Rui Terence testified that when there was no “<em>interpretable DNA</em>”, it could be due to a variety of reasons. For example, there could be a lack of DNA in cases where DNA had been deposited but degraded, or the touch was not enough to leave DNA to be detected. He explained that the length of touch might affect how much DNA is deposited on an item and how certain people may also have a higher tendency to leave DNA behind but was quick to add that how much DNA is detected also depends on the environment, for example, it would degrade more rapidly under sunlight<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. He added that “<em>no interpretable DNA</em>” could also mean that “<em>too many people had touched [the exhibit]</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. In short and in relation to this case, no conclusions may be drawn where there was no “<em>interpretable DNA</em>” found on the drug exhibits.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ownership, possession and knowledge of the methamphetamine</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Accused admitted to the ownership, possession and knowledge of the methamphetamine recovered from the chalet unit, at the scene when a contemporaneous statement was recorded<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, in his police statements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and in the course of trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. It was undisputed that right from the time of his arrest, the Accused had told the CNB officers that the methamphetamine in the chalet unit was for his own consumption. His defence to the charge of trafficking was that the methamphetamine in his possession were entirely for his personal consumption.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The fact that the Accused was a user of methamphetamine was accepted by the Prosecution. Apart from the drug paraphernalia (syringe, cut straw, improvised glass apparatus) found in the chalet unit which strongly suggested that the Accused was a drug abuser himself, the HSA certificates<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> tendered by the Accused in the course of the Prosecution’s case unequivocally showed that he was a consumer of methamphetamine since his urine was analysed to contain methamphetamine.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Presumption under section 17 MDA triggered</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The fact of possession being undisputed by the Accused, I found that the presumption under section 17 of the MDA was triggered. Section 17 MDA states:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than 25 grammes of methamphetamine shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose”.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In this case, the Accused had in his possession not less than 114.67 grams of methamphetamine. He was thus presumed to have had the methamphetamine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. The burden then shifted to the Accused to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue to be Determined</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The main issue for the Court to determine was whether the Accused had successfully rebutted the presumption on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Accused’s Defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Accused’s defence was that he had the drugs in his possession for his personal consumption.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On the stand, the Accused testified that he was driving along Geylang Lorong 18 on 12 November 2018 when he was stopped by a Traffic Police officer. At that time, the Accused was aware that he was wanted for failing to report for his urine test and for his drug possession charge. Hence, he fled from the scene. Realising that the police would look for him at his home, he decided to get a friend to help him to book a chalet for him in Cherryloft resorts in Pasir Ris.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Accused informed the Court that as he was making his way to Pasir Ris, he received a call from his drug supplier, one “Ah Beng”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. He added that he was “<em>not thinking very clearly</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and he decided to buy drugs as his own drug ration was “<em>running low</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. Further, the person was selling the drugs to him at a “<em>cheap price</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. Upon arriving at Cherryloft resorts, the Accused put all the drugs into a grey coloured pouch and put it under the bed on the second level of the chalet unit. The Accused stated that that he did not check the quantity of the drugs he bought. He merely opened the cover to look inside before closing it which explained why his DNA was found on the “<em>flip of the blue coloured plastic</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. He had not taken the drugs out of the packets itself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In urging the Court to believe that the methamphetamine were all for his own consumption, the Accused relied on the concentration levels of methamphetamine found in his urine when it was tested by HSA analysts. According to the evidence of PW12 Ng Xue Qin and PW13 Goh Mei Ling Evelyn, the concentration levels of methamphetamine in the two samples of Accused’s urine was 37,100 nanograms per millilitre of urine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and 34,000 nanograms per millilitre of urine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> respectively. Both of the HSA analysts agreed that the cut-off for reporting urine as being positive for methamphetamine was 500 nanograms per millilitre of urine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Based on the concentration levels of methamphetamine found in his urine, the Accused asserted that he was a heavy drug user; that he relied on the drug every day<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Accused also highlighted that there was no evidence of trafficking against him. His mobile phone was checked and there were no phone messages in it which implicated him in the selling of drugs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. An outgoing call was made by PW4 Muhammad Fardlie bin Ramlie to a random number in the Accused’s mobile phone but that yielded no result<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. The Accused stressed that there was no evidence of him attempting to sell drugs or getting people to buy drugs from him and further, he was not a known trafficker<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Court’s Findings on the Evidence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">No act of trafficking needed to be proved</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Accused submitted that the Prosecution had failed to prove any act of “trafficking” as defined in section 2 of the MDA against him. There was no evidence that he was trafficking in methamphetamine. In his submissions, the Accused highlighted the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused’s handphone was checked and there were no phone messages or phone records which implicated him in the selling or trafficking of drugs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was no accomplice arrested in connection with his trafficking<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was no evidence that the Accused had left the chalet unit to deliver, sell or distribute methamphetamine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     Prior to the Accused’s arrest, the CNB had not received any intelligence that he was a trafficker nor had he been arrested on that basis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. On the evidence, PW1 CNB officer Au Yong Hong Mian who filed the arrest report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, stated that the party of CNB officers had acted on information received and arrested the Accused on suspicion of consuming a controlled drug, not for trafficking. PW14 Wong Kah Hung Alwyn confirmed that the main reason why the CNB officers had raided the chalet was because of the Accused’s earlier incident with the Traffic Police and he was also “<em>wanted</em>” by the CNB<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Suffice to say, the Accused’s observations above were accurately encapsulated but misplaced.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Effect of the presumption under section 17 of the MDA</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     By sheer operation of the presumption under section 17 of the MDA, the Prosecution was not required to prove any act of trafficking on the part of the Accused. All that the Prosecution needed to prove was that a quantity of methamphetamine (above 25 grams) recovered from the chalet unit that day was in the possession of the Accused. The Prosecution had no trouble proving possession since the Accused readily admitted that the entire lot of methamphetamine, all 114.67 grams of it, seized from the chalet unit was his; just that they were for his personal consumption and not for the purpose of trafficking.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Put in another way, the Prosecution need not prove that the Accused had sold, given, administered, transported, sent, delivered or distributed or offered to do any of those acts (definition of “<em>traffic</em>” in section 2 of the MDA), in relation to the methamphetamine the Accused had in his possession, in order to sustain a conviction of trafficking in this case i.e. no overt act of trafficking was necessary. The Prosecution did not have to produce an accomplice, a buyer or any text messages, phone records or any phone activity to prove that the Accused was engaged in any act of trafficking. There would also not be any need on the Prosecution’s part to produce a closed circuit television footage (CCTV), as asked for by the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>, showing that that the Accused had left the chalet to deliver/distribute or sell the drugs to any individual. It also did not matter that the CNB officers had arrested the Accused based on information which did not implicate him in the trafficking of drugs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The presumption in section 17 of the MDA was properly triggered in this case and the Prosecution was entitled to rely on it to prove their case of trafficking against the Accused. The burden then shifted to the Accused to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">One may be a consumer of drugs as well as a trafficker of drugs</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Accused stressed that he was a consumer of methamphetamine. However, the fact that the Accused was a consumer of methamphetamine could not, on its own, rebut the presumption of trafficking. One may very well be a consumer of drugs as well as a trafficker of drugs. The presence of drug smoking paraphernalia in the chalet may go towards strengthening the Accused’s position that he was a drug consumer, which in any event was not a fact disputed by the Prosecution but again, that similarly could not on its own, rebut the presumption that the Accused had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking as well.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Results of DNA profiling of drug exhibits were inconclusive</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In respect of the DNA profiling done on the drug exhibits seized from the chalet unit, I was of the view that there was no meaningful inference that could be drawn from the presence of the Accused’s DNA on the blue packets (“A1A”, “A1B”, “A1C”). The presence of the Accused’s DNA on these blue packets only meant that he had handled these four blue packets prior to his arrest. Whether the Accused had handled them as a consumer upon purchase of these drugs from his seller or as a trafficker who had packed the drugs and put them into the four blue packets, was indeterminate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As for the rest of the drug exhibits where no interpretable DNA could be obtained, similarly, no meaningful inferences could be drawn from these results. Whilst the absence of non-interpretable DNA did not mean that the Accused did not handle the drug exhibits, it also did not show that he did handle them or that he was the only one who handled them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In short, no conclusions relevant to the issue of whether the Accused was a trafficker in drugs could be drawn from the result of the DNA profiling of any of the drug exhibits.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused’s explanation for having this quantity of drugs in his possession for his own consumption was incredible</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The quantity of methamphetamine in the Accused’s possession was large</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I make the preliminary observation that the quantity of methamphetamine found in the Accused’s possession was large. The quantity of methamphetamine of 114.67 grams was more than four times the weight required to trigger the presumption of trafficking under section 17 of the MDA presumption.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In his testimony, the Accused explained how he came into possession of the drugs for his own consumption and asserted that he was a heavy user of methamphetamine.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Accused’s account of why and how he came into possession of the drugs was illogical</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On the Accused’s account, I agreed with the Prosecution that it was illogical why the Accused would have needed to have in his possession such a large amount of drugs for his own consumption at the material time:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was the Accused’s own testimony that he was intending to surrender himself to the CNB in a few days<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. That was the reason why the Accused wanted to spend more time with his family at the resort<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. Since that was the case, there would have been no reason for the Accused to have bought the amount of drugs he did (150 grams of methamphetamine)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> from one “<em>Ah Beng</em>” just before his surrender. According to the Accused, he already had drugs with him which would have been sufficient to last him for at least four days, before he intended to surrender himself to the CNB<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. The Accused’s own version of events was contradictory;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     On the Accused’s own account that he had ready drug suppliers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>, there would also be no reason why the Accused would have needed to buy and store such a large amount of drugs at any one time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I also found it hard to believe the Accused’s bare assertion that he had obtained the drugs from “Ah Beng” for his own consumption just before going to the resort. The Accused failed to produce any evidence of the alleged conversation with “Ah Beng” and claimed that he had deleted his whatsapp application after purchasing the drugs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. Apart from the fact that the Accused produced no evidence to support his assertion of the purchase from the said “Ah Beng”, the timing of the meet-up with the said “Ah Beng” also seemed awkward and untimely. At that time, the Accused was “<em>wanted</em>” and on the run from CNB; he just had an encounter with the Traffic Police officer where he fled the scene. The Accused also testified that he knew he would be arrested very soon after his incident with the Traffic Police officer and knew “<em>the game was up</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. It was fairly inconceivable that the Accused would still have the presence of mind to meet “Ah Beng” to buy drugs at this time. The Accused’s explanation for his purchase on the basis that he was “<em>very stressed</em>” and “<em>very blur</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> were convenient excuses for the untimeliness of the purported purchase.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In my view, even if the Accused’s claim of having bought drugs from one “Ah Beng” just before he went to the resort could be accepted as true, it did not mean that he did not have the methamphetamine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. The fact remained that when the Accused was arrested, he had in his possession that large amount of methamphetamine which gave rise to the presumption that he had the drugs with him for trafficking; it did not strictly matter how or when he had obtained them and from whom. The more crucial question was whether it was believable that the Accused had 114.67 grams of methamphetamine entirely for his personal consumption at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Level of concentration of methamphetamine in Accused’s urine was inconclusive of Accused’s drug use </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Accused attempted to show that the level of concentration of methamphetamine detected in each sample of his urine as examined by the HSA analysts was high and therefore, he must have been a heavy user of methamphetamine, which in turn justified him possessing the large quantity of methamphetamine at the chalet unit. However, the co-relation which the Accused made was unsupported by the evidence of HSA analysts PW12 Ng Xue Qin and PW13 Goh Mei Ling Evelyn.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the first place, even though both the HSA analysts agreed with the Accused that the cut-off for reporting urine as being positive for methamphetamine was 500 nanograms, neither of them could agree that the amounts of methamphetamine of 37,100 nanograms per milliliter and 34,000 nanograms per milliliter were “<em>high</em>”. PW12 Ng Xue Qin stated that she would not put a gauge on whether the concentration was high, low or medium<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> whilst PW13 Goh Mei Ling Evelyn testified that 34,000 nanograms of milliliter of urine concentration of methamphetamine “<em>is the usual range - one of the range that we will see in---in the urine samples</em>”. She found it difficult to comment whether it was high or low<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. It appeared that the Accused was the only one who considered the level of concentration in his urine sample to be high.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Second and more importantly, the level of concentration of methamphetamine in Accused’s urine was inconclusive of the Accused’s drug use. Based on the testimonies of HSA analysts PW12 Ng Xue Qin and PW13 Goh Mei Ling Evelyn, it was clear that they could not draw a co-relation between the level of concentration of methamphetamine found in one’s urine to one’s consumption rate<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. This was because there were too many variable factors involved. These factors included the water intake of the consumer, one’s metabolism rate, when the drugs were last consumed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> et cetera. The evidence of the HSA analysts did not support the assertions of the Accused in respect of his consumption rate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In summary, apart from the lack of affirmation from HSA witnesses that the level of concentration of methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine could be regarded as high, the level of concentration of methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine also could not indicate that he must have been a heavy user of methamphetamine. Hence, other than the Accused’s own assertion, there was no evidence that the Accused was such a heavy user of methamphetamine that would justify him having such a large amount of methamphetamine in his possession at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Accused did not have the financial means to support his purported rate of consumption</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Accused also did not have the financial means to support his purported rate of consumption.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In evidence, Accused claimed to have a consumption rate of at least 5 grams of methamphetamine a day, on an average quality of methamphetamine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. According to the Accused, he had bought 50 grams of “<em>average quality</em>” methamphetamine for about $1,000 in August 2018<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. In a month, that would mean that the Accused would require about 150 grams of methamphetamine which would cost about $3,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Accused’s claim of his heavy drug use was not credible in light of his financial situation. The Prosecution described it well at paragraphs 39-43 of their closing submissions:-</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     Accused’s income from being an odd-job worker was unstable and the pay fluctuated based on the number of jobs he had<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. When he worked with Amazon Flex, he was paid about $45-$100 a day<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> which comes up to about $1,300 to $3,000 a month. Accused claimed to have other sources of income but there was no objective evidence in the form of pay slips or banking transactions to show sources of income that would be able to finance his high rate of drug consumption;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     He had no savings in the form of money in bank accounts; the account balances for his bank accounts were constantly low, and even in the negative<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>. It was a bare assertion that the Accused made when he claimed to have cash with him;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     As for expenses, the Accused admitted that the income he earned from Amazon Flex would go towards paying off his debts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> (consistent with his police statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>), excluding car rental which cost about $1,000 a month and monthly expenses of $200-$300 a month<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I agreed with the Prosecution that the overall picture of the Accused’s financial situation was that of a “<em>debt-ridden individual, living in a rental flat, living off an unsteady income that fluctuates from month to month, who spends most of his income on debts</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>. I was skeptical as to how the Accused was able to sustain his drug habit and have the means to pay for his heavy drug use which may amount to some $3,000 a month, based on the Accused’s own estimates.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Accused testified that he earned income from remote gambling activities. In support, he produced a letter from the police wherein he was given a stern warning for an offence of unlawful remote gambling committed on 29 February 2018 (Exhibit D3). However, I did not find the production of such a letter to aid the Accused’s case. Apart from the fact that the letter referred to an offence of remote gambling committed nine months before the trafficking offence, the contents of the letter from the police failed to indicate how much money had been involved in the Accused’s unlawful remote gambling activities, how much he had earned or accumulated through remote gambling; what his wins and losses had been. A mere production of such a letter could not support the Accused’s assertion that he had an alternate source of income which provided him the means to purchase the drugs to support his heavy drug consumption. I did not find the Accused’s assertion of his heavy drug usage to be credible.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Circumstantial evidence of drug trafficking</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It was undisputed that certain paraphernalia commonly used in connection with drug trafficking activites were seized from the chalet unit, along with 114.67 grams of methamphetamine. These were:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     a weighing scale (Exhibit P28); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     one packet containing numerous and two different types of empty sachets (Exhibit P29).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The presence of these items suggested that the drugs were to be weighed and then packed to be sold or distributed. Whilst they did not constitute conclusive evidence of trafficking, the presence of these items found in the possession of the Accused, together with a large amount of methamphetamine, corroborated the Prosecution’s case that the Accused did have 114.67 grams of methamphetamine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Weighing scale</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In relation to the weighing scale, the Accused offered inconsistent evidence surrounding the use of the weighing scale<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> in his police statements. First, he stated that he would use the weighing scale to weigh “<em>ice</em>” when he purchased them so he would not get cheated by his suppliers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. Subsequently, he informed the recorder that the weighing scale was spoilt and added that he had never used it to weigh “<em>ice</em>” before<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. This was clearly untrue since the weighing scale was found to be stained by methamphetamine and ketamine when it was examined by HSA analyst PW9 Lee Yan Kai. The Accused’s evidence in relation to the weighing scale was illogical and inconsistent.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">One packet containing numerous and two different types of empty packets</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Accused admitted that there were two types of empty packets found in his possession<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. One stack was clear, transparent sealable packets; the other was transparent packets with floral patterns<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>, which the Accused referred to as “<em>quick paste</em>”. Accused claimed that he used the clear, transparent packets to ration his drugs for his own consumption, adding that it was his “<em>style</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> of rationing the drugs, for him to “<em>travel with</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>, whilst the packets with the floral patterns were used to put his glass pipe.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     No glass pipes were seized from the chalet unit and several CNB officers who were called as rebuttal witnesses, could not recall seeing any glass pipes or broken glass in the room where the Accused was. There was no evidence to support the existence of glass pipes in the chalet unit that day. Even if there were these glass pipes, the court was left guessing whether they were of a size which could fit into the floral-patterned packet which Accused claimed was used to keep his glass pipe. I further observed that the apparatus seen in Photo P3-8 and labelled as “C1A2”, were not contained in any floral-patterned packet. In any case as pointed out by Prosecution, it was not evident why the Accused would have need for multiple empty floral-patterned packets to store his glass pipe<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>. The explanations offered by the Accused as to the use of these empty packets were easy and convenient to assert and may even be plausible, but they failed to adequately justify why the Accused would require numerous transparent packets of different sizes and distinguished by pattern. I was not convinced by the Accused’s explanations.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Close of Defence’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Accused submitted strenuously that the Court should be aware that the Prosecution is “<em>relying only on section 17 MDA and there is not a single evidence of trafficking</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>. As discussed, under the provisions of the MDA, the Prosecution is entitled to do that, given the weight of methamphetamine found in the possession of the Accused, with no requirement of proof of any overt act of trafficking. Once the presumption was triggered, it was for the Accused to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities, that the drugs were not for trafficking but entirely for his consumption.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In <em>Jusri bin Mohamed Hussain v PP <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0706.xml')">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 706</a> at</em> [62], a case where the offender similarly raised the defence of consumption in an attempt to rebut the statutory presumption in section 17 of the MDA, the High Court stated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“In conclusion, I was of the view that before any meaningful apportionment can be made, there must be credible evidence that part of the drugs found were meant for self-consumption. There must also be credible evidence of the rate of consumption as well as the number of days the supply is meant for. So far as the last item is concerned, as was noted by Rajendran J in PP v Dahalan bin Ladaewa, this should be looked at in connection with the frequency of supply.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>In this respect, credible evidence does not mean the mere say-so of the accused. I appreciate that it is often difficult for an accused to adduce any other evidence apart from his own testimony. However, it seems to me that it must follow from the statutory presumption in s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act that an accused found in possession of a large quantity of drugs faces an uphill task. It cannot be right that the court is obliged to accept in all cases the bare allegation of the accused. That would make nonsense out of s 17.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The observation was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Muhammad bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20126-SSP.xml')">[2017] 1 SLR 427</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Even though the Accused was clearly an abuser of methamphetamine, there was no evidence to corroborate his assertion that he was a heavy consumer of the drug or that he had the financial means to support such an addiction. There was no credible evidence of his purported rate of consumption and even his own account of why he would require such a large amount of drugs when he already intended to surrender to the authorities, was self-contradictory. Overall, I did not find the Accused’s defence to be credible. The nature of the drug-related paraphernalia found with the Accused in the chalet unit also militated against his defence. On a total consideration of the evidence, I found that the Accused had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">No apportionment of drugs for Accused’s consumption</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Whilst I was aware that the Accused was a consumer of methamphetamine, I did not think it was appropriate to apportion an amount of the methamphetamine found in his possession for his consumption. There ought to be reliable evidence before the court before any meaningful apportionment may be made<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>; however, there was none before me. The only evidence before the Court was the Accused’s claim that he would consume at least 5 grams of methamphetamine per day, and even that would depend on the quality of methamphetamine he had. That was also the Accused’s own assertion, unsupported by any objective evidence, in his attempt to rebut the presumption of trafficking. In my view, any attempt at apportionment would be largely speculative. In any case, the quantity of methamphetamine found in the Accused’s possession was large and any apportionment may unlikely have an impact on the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Considering the totality of the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proved their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt on the charge as it was presented by the Prosecution. I thus found the Accused guilty and convicted him on DAC 937598/2018.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The stood down charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Upon conviction and taking up the Prosecution’s offer in respect of 13 stood down charges, the Accused pleaded guilty to nine charges and agreed to have four other charges taken into consideration.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The nine charges to which the Accused pleaded guilty were:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     One count of consumption of methamphetamine under Section 8(b)(ii) p/u section 33A(1), MDA;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     Three counts of failing to present himself for urine test under Reg 15(3)(f) Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, RG 3) p/u Reg 15(6)(a) of the Regulations;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     Two counts of possession of methamphetamine (9.86 grams and 0.5 grams) under Section 8(a) p/u Section 33(1) MDA;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     One count of possession of two tablets containing nimetazepam under Section 8(a) p/u Section 33(1) MDA;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_e"></a>(e)     One count under Section 338(a) Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_f"></a>(f)     One count under Section 177 Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Accused admitted and consented to two other drug-related charges, one charge under section 336(a) of the Penal Code and one charge under section 7(1)(a) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act, Chapter 65 to be taken into consideration for purpose of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Accused’s Antecedents </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Accused had a fairly long criminal record beginning from 1998.

He also had violence-related antecedents in the form of voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon, criminal intimidation, using of criminal force.

For trafficking in 114.67 grams of methamphetamine, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 8.5 years’ imprisonment and 7 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Prosecution took guidance from the case of <em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17811-SSP.xml')">[2015] SGHC 217</a>. In <em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan</em>, the court was of the view that the indicative starting points for sentencing first-time traffickers in <em>Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor </em><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17702-SSP.xml')">[2015] SGHC 197</a> could be adapted for use where the drug trafficked was methamphetamine. The court considered it possible to derive “<em>some sort of conversion scale or “exchange rate”, so to speak, between diamorphine and methamphetamine</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The court in <em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan</em> went on to observe at [17]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“This is because the Second Schedule of the MDA prescribes the exact same minimum and maximum punishments for trafficking between 10g and 15g of diamorphine and trafficking between 167g and 250g of methamphetamine – the minimum is 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and the maximum is imprisonment for life or 30 years and 15 strokes of the cane. This means that, all other things being equal, an offender who traffics between 10g and 15g of diamorphine is to be considered as culpable as a person who traffics between 167g and 250g of methamphetamine. Doing the arithmetic, the culpability of an offender who traffics one gram of diamorphine is equivalent to the culpability of an identically-situated offender who traffics 16.7g of methamphetamine.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Following the reasoning in <em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan</em>, the Prosecution set out a table of indicative sentences for first time traffickers of methamphetamine, depending on the weight of the methamphetamine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="24.92%"/> <col width="24.92%"/> <col width="24.92%"/> <col width="25.24%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">From <em>Vasentha</em></p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Converted</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprison-ment</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Caning</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Weight of Diamorphine </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Weight of Methamphet-amine</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5-6 years</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5-6 strokes</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">0-3 g</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">0-50 g</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6-7 years</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6-7 strokes</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3-5 g</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50-84 g</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7-8 years</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7-8 strokes</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5-7 g</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">84-117 g</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8-9 years</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8-9 strokes</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7-8 g</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">117-134 g</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10-13 years</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9-10 strokes</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8-9 g</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">134 – 150 g</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13-15 years</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10-11 strokes</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9-9.99g</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">150-166.99 g</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     For a net weight of 114.67 grams of methamphetamine, a strict arithmetic approach would yield a starting point of approximately 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment and 7-8 strokes of the cane.

I agreed with the Prosecution that the weight of 114.67 g of methamphetamine found in the possession of the Accused for the purpose of trafficking would indicate a sentence of about 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment and 7-8 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In this case, I decided that a sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment with 7 strokes of the cane would be a sufficient sentence, taking into account the need for specific deterrence in light of the Accused’s persistent association with drugs prior to the current trafficking offence committed in November 2018, and even after he was arrested for other drug offences in March 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consumption of methamphetamine (DAC 902123/2019)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     This offence of consumption, committed on or about 11 November 2018, carried along with it a minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, since the Accused had been previously convicted of two offences of consumption of a specified drug, in 2004 and 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I did not see the need to impose a sentence higher than the minimum sentence prescribed for the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Failing to report for urine test (DAC 909231/2019 and 2 others)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Accused was subjected to a Supervision Order for a period of 24 months with effect from 17 December 2016 when he failed to present himself for urine testing on 5 October 2018, 12 October 2018 and 26 October 2018 – the three occasions, as stated in the charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I imposed 4 months’ imprisonment on each of the three charges. This was a sentence on the lower end of the range of sentences usually imposed on offences of this nature. Despite the fact that the Accused had failed to turn up on 21 occasions for urine reporting, I took into account that he had pleaded guilty and was already facing long imprisonment terms on the trafficking and consumption charges.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Possession of drugs charges (3 counts)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Prior to his arrest at the chalet on 13 November 2018, the Accused was placed under arrest for being in possession of three different types of drugs on 23 March 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment on both the charges of possessing 9.86 grams of methamphetamine and 0.5 grams of MDMA. The learned DPP cited the case of <em>Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0001.xml')">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 1</a>, submitting that his proposed sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was well within the range of 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment<em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></em>. The Prosecution highlighted that the Accused had a previous drug possession charge which was taken into consideration in 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Bearing in mind that methamphetamine was a “Class A” controlled drug and the Accused also had one other charge of possession of methamphetamine taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing (DAC 902125/2019), I imposed a 12-month imprisonment term for possession of 9.86 grams of methamphetamine. As for 0.5 g of MDMA, it was similarly a Class A controlled drug. However, noting the small quantity involved, I imposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment. For the offence of possessing” Class C” controlled drugs in the form of two tablets of nimetazepam (DAC 909236/2019), I was of the view that a term of 6 months’ imprisonment would be sufficient. This was also the sentence sought for by the Prosecution on this charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Incident on 12 November 2018</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The Accused’s encounter with officer from the Traffic Police on 12 November 2018 resulted in two charges against the Accused. The two charges were: -</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 935316/2019</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“You…are charged that you, on the 12th day of November 2018, sometime after 2.20pm, near Lorong 18 Geylang, Singapore, did cause grievous hurt to one Staff Sergeant Noor Hakim Bin Mohamed (“SSGT Hakim”), by doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life, to wit, by stepping on the accelerator of a motor car bearing licence plate number SJA4805U when SSGT Hakim was partially inside the said motor car and holding onto you through the open door at the driver’s side of the said motor car, and driving the said motor car for a distance of about 30 to 40 metres, causing SSGT Hakim to be flung off onto the road, which act caused SSGT Hakim to sustain a right ankle fracture, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 338(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)”.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <u>DAC 935317/2019</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“You…are charged that you, on the 12th day of November 2018, sometime after 2.20pm, near Lorong 18 Geylang, Singapore, being legally bound to furnish information, namely, your name and address in Singapore, to a public servant, one Staff Sergeant Noor Hakim Bin Mohamed, a police officer of the Singapore Police Force, did furnish, as true, information that you knew to be false, namely, that your name was “Muhd Nazri Bin Taib” bearing NRIC number XXX, and that you resided at “509 Ang Mo Kio” in Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 177 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The facts relating to these two offences for causing grievous hurt by a rash act under section 338(a) and for giving false information when he was legally bound to furnish information under section 177, both of the Penal Code, are set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Statement of Facts relating to DAC 935316/2019 and DAC 935317/2019</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The victim is Staff Sergeant Noor Hakim Bin Mohamed (“SSGT Hakim”). At the material time, he was a police officer of the Singapore Police Force, attached to the Traffic Police Patrol Team.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     On 12 November 2018 sometime after 2.20pm, SSGT Hakim was on patrol duty in uniform when he noticed a Blue Subaru motor car bearing licence plate number SJA4805U (“the vehicle”) travelling along Geylang Road towards Kallang Road, Singapore. At the time, the Accused was driving the vehicle. SSGT Hakim observed that the Accused was holding onto a mobile phone with his left hand, with his right hand holding onto the steering wheel. SSGT Hakim thus directed the Accused to stop his vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Accused stopped the vehicle near lamp post number 51F, just after Lorong 18 Geylang, Singapore. SSGT Hakim directed the Accused to step out of the vehicle. The Accused informed SSGT Hakim that he did not have any identification documents with him. SSGT Hakim instructed the Accused to sit at the backseat of the vehicle. At the time, the vehicle’s car engine was switched off, but the car keys were still in the ignition.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     After the Accused was seated, SSGT Hakim asked for his personal particulars, which included his name, NRIC, and address. At the material time, SSGT Hakim, who was in uniform, had suspected the Accused of having committed an offence under the Road Traffic Act. The Accused, who was legally bound to furnish information of his name and address in Singapore to SSGT Hakim, identified himself as one “Muhd Nazri Bin Taib” bearing NRIC number XXX. When SSGT Hakim asked the Accused to spell out “Muhd” in full, the Accused became agitated and later spelt out “Muhd” as “Muhammad”. The Accused also provided his address in Singapore as “509 Ang Mo Kio”. At the material time, the Accused’s name was not “Muhd Nazri Bin Taib” and neither did he reside at “509 Ang Mo Kio” in Singapore. The Accused knew that this information that he provided to SSGT Hakim was false.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     SSGT Hakim screened the NRIC provided by the Accused and was informed that the bearer’s name was “Mohamed Nazri Bin Taib” (instead of “Muhammad Nazri Bin Taib”). SSGT Hakim then called for reinforcements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     When the Accused overheard SSGT Hakim calling for reinforcements, he squeezed his body in between the two front seats of the vehicle, and tried to start the vehicle’s engine using the car keys that were still left on the ignition. SSGT Hakim tried to stop the Accused from driving off by attempting to pull him out of the vehicle. At or around the same time, a female passerby, one Norazidah Binte Mohamed, also began pulling at the Accused from the other side of the vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     While SSGT Hakim and the said female passerby were both pulling at the Accused, the Accused managed to step on the accelerator and drive off. At the time, SSGT Hakim was partially inside the vehicle and still holding onto the accused through the open door at the driver’s side of the vehicle. The accused drove the vehicle for about 30 to 40 metres along the road before SSGT Hakim was flung off and fell onto the road. The Accused subsequently drove the vehicle to Toa Payoh, Singapore. At the material time, the Accused was wanted by the Central Narcotics Bureau in relation to his failure to report for urine tests under a Supervision Order.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     SSGT Hakim was conveyed by ambulance to the Emergency Department of Raffles Hospital for medical treatment. The medical report dated 10 December 2018 stated that SSGT Hakim sustained swelling and tenderness over the right ankle and lateral malleolus, with range of movement slightly restricted. He was discharged with pain killers and muscle relaxants.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     SSGT Hakim later sought further medical attention at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”). The KTPH medical report dated 4 January 2019 stated that SSGT Hakim underwent X-rays which showed a small bony fragment at the tip of the right medial malleolus. The clinical impression was that of a right ankle fracture. SSGT Hakim was treated conservatively and discharged with referral for outpatient orthopaedics review. He was given 14 days of hospitalization leave from 16 November 2018 to 29 November 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Causing grievous hurt by a rash act under section 338(a) of the Penal Code</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 338(a) of the Penal Code is a fine up to $10,000 or imprisonment which may extend to 4 years, or both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Prosecution sought a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment. The learned DPP informed the court that the precedents under section 338(a) of the Penal Code which he found were factually dissimilar; hence, he did not consider them to be relevant. The more helpful cases were under section 337(a) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     From the table of precedents for offences under section 337(a), the Prosecution highlighted that where the offenders committed rash driving offences in the course of trying to evade arrest or detection of wrongful activities in the course of which, simple hurt was caused to public officers, a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment had been imposed. The facts in the precedents under section 337(a) bore this out.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Even though the current offence was a more serious charge of causing grievous hurt instead of simple hurt, the DPP informed the court that a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment would be adequate, taking into account the “<em>totality and hefty sentences</em>” that the Accused already faced for the other charges. The Prosecution also pointed out that although the injury to the police officer was a fracture and thus constituted “grievous hurt”, it was relatively minor, with no indication that the officer had sustained any permanent or long-term injuries<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     On the charge proceeded on and the facts, I was of the view that a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment would have been justified. The charge to which the Accused pleaded guilty to was a more serious one under section 338(a) of the Penal Code and the hurt he had caused the Traffic Police officer was grievous. The Accused’s rash conduct in seeking to evade arrest clearly put both the lives of SSGT Hakim and one Mdm Norazidah, a passer-by (subject matter of a section 336(a) Penal Code charge which was taken into consideration) in peril.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Notwithstanding the foregoing, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions and accepted the DPP’s calibration of the appropriate sentence to 9 months’ imprisonment for this offence. I also saw it necessary to ban the Accused from driving for a period of 3 years.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Furnishing false information under section 177 of the Penal Code</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The punishment prescribed for this offence is a imprisonment term up to 6 months, a fine which may extend to $5,000, or both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In this case, I was amply satisfied that the custodial threshold had been crossed. The Accused was legally bound to furnish his personal particulars to the Traffic Police officer when he was stopped for using his mobile phone whilst driving, and he chose to give false particulars – not only the name but the identity card number as well as the address. The Accused’s motivations for doing so were obvious since he was “wanted” for failing to report for urine testing. His culpability was on the higher end. The level of potential harm was also great since the Accused’s actions could have implicated an innocent person and wasted investigative resources had the officer not conducted a screening at the scene. In this case, the Accused also seized the opportunity which arose from the giving of his false particulars by getting into the front seat of the car and successfully driving the vehicle away.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The facts surrounding the offence and the Accused’s conduct were more egregious than any of the precedents listed in the Prosecution’s table of precedents. I was of the view that 2 months’ imprisonment was the appropriate sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Aggregate Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     To reiterate, the

These offences were different in nature and clearly distinct; they were also committed on different occasions and did not breach the one-transaction rule.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The total sentence was: 8 years' and 25 months' imprisonment with effect from 14 November 2018 and 10 strokes of the cane.
