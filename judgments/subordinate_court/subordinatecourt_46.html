</tbody> </table> <p></p> <p class="Judg-Author"> District Judge John Ng:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Accused is Mohamed Ardlee Iriandee bin Mohamed Sanip, a male 41-year-old Singapore citizen. The Accused was arrested on 22 May 2018 for the offence of Attempted Outrage of Modesty with wrongful restraint of a girl under 14 years of age committed on 21 May 2018. After investigations were conducted, it was discovered that he was involved in the Outrage of Modesty with wrongful restraint of another girl under 14 years old on 22 January 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Accused was charged in court with two charges arising from the two different incidents which had occurred four months apart. The charge of Attempted Outrage of Modesty (DAC 918249/2018) to which the Accused intended to plead guilty was stood down pending the trial of the contested charge (DAC 918768/2018).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Contested Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Accused claimed trial to the following charge:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>DAC-918768-2018</b>,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “You, Mohamed Ardlee Iriandee bin Mohamed Sanip, male / 39 years old, Singaporean are charged that you, on 22 January 2018, at or about 3.00 pm, at the staircase area at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor of [address redacted], did use criminal force to one [name redacted], female / then 8 years old (D.O.B. 12 February 2009), <em>to wit</em>, by placing your hand under her school uniform and touching her vagina area over her underwear, intending to outrage her modesty, and in order to commit this offence, you did voluntarily cause wrongful restraint to the said [name redacted] by grabbing onto her arm and preventing her from leaving whilst you were touching her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       An Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”) was submitted jointly by the Prosecution and the Defence at the start of the trial. The ASOF contained the following material information for the trial.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Undisputed Facts for the Contested Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the material time, the Accused was employed as a regular with the Singapore Armed Forces, based in SAFTI MI at Upper Jurong Road, Singapore. The victim (“V1”) was a Primary 3 student at a primary school located near the scene of the crime.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 22 January 2018, at about 3pm, after school, V1 and her classmate (PW4) were walking to PW4’s grandparents’ unit on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor of a block of flats. They encountered the Accused at the void deck of that block of flats. The Accused followed them into a lift. The two girls exited the lift at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor. The Accused took the lift to the next level and exited at the 7<sup>th</sup> floor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       V1 accompanied PW4 to the doorstep of her grandparents’ unit before making her way back to the lift landing. In the meantime, the Accused had kept watch of her from the 7<sup>th</sup> floor. As V1 was walking back to the lift landing, the Accused went down the staircase next to the lift lobby, approached V1 and grabbed her by her hand. The alleged incident of molest occurred after the Accused had pulled V1 by her hand from the lift lobby to the staircase landing. V1 said “stop it” several times during the incident and the Accused then let go of her and ran down the staircase. V1 walked back to PW4’s grandparent’s unit and disclosed the incident to PW4 and her aunt (PW3). PW3 called V1’s parents. A police report was subsequently lodged on the same day.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Accused admitted that he had followed V1 and PW4 into the lift. The two girls exited the lift at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor while the Accused remained in the lift and exited at the 7<sup>th</sup> floor. From the higher floor, he observed V1 walking back to the lift after PW4 had entered her flat unit. The Accused went down the stairs and approached V1 and grabbed her hand. He pulled V1 to the staircase landing. What transpired after the Accused had pulled V1 to the staircase landing to the point that the Accused let go of her hand and ran down the staircase to the ground floor is in dispute. After the Accused had released the hand of V1, she went to her friend’s flat and her parents were informed of the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Accused’s entering of the lift with V1 and PW4 was captured on CCTV inside the lift. However, the CCTV did not capture the specific incident between the Accused and V1 at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor staircase landing where he was grabbing her hand and she was holding onto the railings with the other hand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Accused was arrested on 22 May 2018 in the course of investigations for an incident involving a second victim, which is the subject-matter of the admitted charge in DAC 918249/2018.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Accused had always admitted that he was the assailant in both incidents and did not deny that he had attacked the two victims, save that on both occasions, he had not succeeded in molesting them.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Key Point of Contention in the Contested Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As set out above, based on the ASOF and the admissions of the Accused, there is no issue on the identity of the Accused as the assailant, the occurrence of the attack on V1 at the date, time and location specified in the charge, and the intention of the Accused to commit an outrage of modesty on the girl.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The key point of contention by the Defence is that the Accused did not touch the vagina area over the underwear of V1 in the course of holding onto her hand while she was holding onto the railing with her other hand. Based on the evidence adduced in the course of the trial and the respective closing submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence, the relevant issues raised in order to resolve the key point of contention are:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the testimony of V1 is reliable.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether V1 had been coached to give her evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the Accused had touched V1’s vagina area accidentally.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At the end of the trial, I was satisfied that V1 is a reliable witness, that she had given credible evidence and her evidence was sufficient for the court to find the Accused guilty of the contested charge. The Prosecution had proven the case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The following are my findings on the relevant issues presented in this case to resolve the key point of contention and the reasons for arriving at those findings.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reliability of V1’s Evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     How is the Court to assess whether the evidence given in court by a 10-year-old victim of a sexual offence is reliable? I begin by referring to the observations of the Court of Appeal in in <em>Public Prosecutor v GCK</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24095-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGCA 2</a> at [97]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “We note in passing that in Canada, children are no longer regarded as a suspect category of witnesses. As the Supreme Court of Canada observed in <em>R</em> v W(R) [1992] 2 SCR 122 (“<em>RW”</em>) at [25]-[26], the evidence of children should not be assessed from the perspective of rigid stereotypes, but on a common-sense basis. Each child witness, regardless of his or her age, should have his or her credibility and evidence assessed by reference to criteria appropriate to his or her mental development, understanding, and ability to communicate…”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I understood from the above observations that the evidence of a child should be assessed in the light of her ability to communicate, bearing in mind her mental development and understanding. In this case, I had based my assessment on how well she was able to express herself when questions were asked of her, whether she was able to describe what had happened with details that showed the clarity of her recollection, and whether she was able to remember the sequence of events and recount what happened in a clear and logical manner.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I had assessed if she was able to understand the questions posed by the DPP and the defence counsel from her responses, if she was able to give coherent answers to the questions which reflect her cognitive capacity to appreciate what was asked of her. I had also paid attention to her ability to follow the proceedings over the course of the examination-in-chief, a significantly detailed and lengthy cross-examination and the re-examination. I found it reasonable for the DPP to submit that in assessing the responses and evidence of V1, due regard must be had to the fact that this was a 10-year-old, Primary 4 student testifying regarding a traumatic incident that occurred about a year and a half prior to her appearance in Court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I found that V1 was able to testify clearly as to what had happened on that day. She remembered that she had walked with PW4 after school to the block of flats where PW4 lived. They had entered the lift together with the Accused. She was able to identify PW4 and herself when shown the CCTV footages inside the lift. V1’s orientation to the place and the time of the incident was not impaired in anyway.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On the incident of the molest during the wrongful restraint of V1 by the Accused, V1 testified that when she reached the lift lobby after walking PW4 home, she saw a stranger (referring to the Accused) walking down the stairs towards her. He said “Hi” and started touching around her chest. (At this juncture of her testimony, V1 was asked by the DPP to stand up to show where she had been touched and she pointed to her right chest area.) V1 told him to stop touching her chest. The Accused then pulled her left hand and pulled her to the staircase while V1 held onto the railing with her right hand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     V1 went on to describe what happened next and how the Accused had touched her vagina area over her underwear as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Q:    Now, you said that he pulled your left hand to the staircase and he had pulled really hard, tell us what else happened at this point?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    He’s starting to put his right hand, um, under my skirt.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    What were you wearing under your skirt?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    My underwear.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Okay. Now, you said that he put his right hand under your skirt.

Now, what---you said he used his hand and he had placed it under your uniform. Can you tell us what he did with his hand?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Um---</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Okay, did you say you don’t understand?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yah.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Okay, let me---so you said, he had touched you with his hand and you pointed out where.

Were you able to stop him from touching you?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    And why did you say that? Why did you say “No.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    He---he was pulling too hard and I couldn’t handle.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Now, that part of your body that you pointed to, what do you call it where he had touched you? Do you want me to ask the question again?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Okay. Now, you said that when he was---he was pulling your hand too hard and you couldn’t handle and at the same time he had touched you under your s---the skirt of your uniform. The part where he touched you with his hand, what do you call it?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I don’t know.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    It’s okay. Now, you said you told him to stop and he was pulling too hard, tell us what happened after this?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    He is---after a while he just let go of my hand and quickly run down the stairs.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p> <div align="right"> (NE Day 2 on 28 June 2019 – from Page 24 at 30 to Page 28 at 19) </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the cross-examination of V1 by the counsel on this aspect, the following exchange took place:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Q:    After that, what happened?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    He pulled me to the stairs.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    He pulled you?

We’ll go back to this photograph which we see in photograph P12.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Is this the place where he pulled you to?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So when he pulled you, he used his left hand, correct? He---held on to your left hand and pulled you to l---to the stairs?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    The what happened? So your right hand was free?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    My right hand was holding onto the railing.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Okay. Was there a struggle between you and him when he pulled you to the stairs?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So which means that when he held onto your left hand and pulled you to the stairs, you resisted, that means you try not to follow him, correct?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    And that was when you used your right had to hold onto the railings?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Okay. From this photograph, would you be able to tell us which part of the railing, as shown here, did you use your right hand to hold? You see, you had the railing which comes from the upper floor. Then you have the railing which goes down to---down the stairs, downwards. So which part?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I can’t remember.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Do you remember whether he was pulling you---so you can’t remember, okay fine. So all the time he was holding on to your left hand and pulling you, and here, your right hand was holding onto---</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    The railing.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    the---the railing. You see, I’m trying to f---to---to---to figure out, [V1]. If he was pulling your hand, it means that he was at least one arm away from you because he was using his left hand to pull you. He was also one arm away from you. Do you understand what I mean?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    … … …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Then, taking into account that he was holding---he was also using his hand to hold you. He was further away from you because of his hand, the distance of his hand.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Correct. During this time when he was holding you, was there a struggle or you just let him lead you to the staircase?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I was struggling.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So if he was a distance away from you, how could he had been close enough to put his hand under your skirt?

V1 clearly and emphatically rejected the version of the Accused put to her by the counsel, with no hesitation or uncertainty. It was then suggested to her that the Accused could have accidentally touched her lower body. She disagreed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As can be seen from the lengthy cross-examination of V1, she was able to appreciate what was asked of her and she was able to provide answers and responses which emanated from a person who spoke of what she had gone through on that day. She was able to describe what was going on and when questions were asked of specific turn of events during the incident, she responded without hesitation, just like a person who had encountered the incident. There were some points she could not remember, and she readily said so. It left no doubt in my mind that she spoke exactly of what the Accused had done to her with one hand in the course of pulling her at the staircase with the other hand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     After a careful consideration of the various aspects of V1’s testimony – demeanour, internal and external consistency – it was clear that the Accused had touched her vagina area over her underwear. In assessing V1’s evidence, I was much guided by the case of <em>Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 3 SLR(R) 0592.xml')">[2001] 3 SLR(R) 592</a> (“<em>Farida Begam</em>”). The appellate court in <em>Farida Begam</em> held at [9] that a judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on his demeanour, the internal consistency and external consistency of his evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the case of <em>Farida Begam</em>, it was held that while the victim’s evidence in relation to the particular incident was generally internally consistent, there was little extrinsic evidence with which her evidence could be compared. There was no other witness to the incident. Hence, the judge’s assessment of her demeanour was significant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Similarly, in the present case. It is not in doubt that V1, and the other witnesses who had interacted with V1 after the incident, had no motive or reason to falsely implicate the Accused. Therefore, the analysis of the evidence had to be focused on the adequacy, or otherwise, of what was seen and experienced by V1 which she could testify to.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     There was one significant aspect of the evidence of V1 which presented some difficulty and that was the fact that V1, a prepubescent 10-year-old, was not able to name the part of her lower body which was touched by the Accused. This was compounded by the fact that V1 was giving evidence from a witness room for vulnerable witnesses through a video-link facility. Since V1 could not name the part of her lower body touched by the Accused, she was asked to stand up and point to the area where she was touched. Initially, the camera angle of the video-link facility did not capture where she had pointed to but after some adjustments, it could be shown which part of her body she had pointed to. It was clear that she had pointed to the vagina area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Defence raised several other aspects of the Prosecution’s case, which the Defence submitted had cast doubts on the reliability of V1’s evidence. I will deal with them in turn.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Defence submitted that V1 did not tell PW4 that the Accused had touched her. V1 also did not describe how she was molested to PW3, the aunt of PW4.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The fact that V1 did not relate all that had happened to her after she got to the home of PW3 and PW4 did not take the Defence very far. V1 had just been attacked by the Accused at the staircase. She was obviously traumatized by the encounter. PW4 saw V1 crying and she asked V1 what had happened. V1 said that someone molested her. PW3 also saw V1 crying and saying that she had been molested. It would be unreasonable to expect V1, in the shaken state that she was in after the violent encounter with the Accused, to be providing specific details to PW3 and PW4 of what had happened to her, other than to say that she had been molested. The main thing on her mind and on the mind of PW3 was to contact her parents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Defence also submitted that the testimony of PW7, the mother of V1, contradicted V1’s evidence on what had happened during the incident. PW7 testified that her daughter had told her that her breast had been squeezed and her private part was touched. The Defence pointed out that V1 only mentioned that her chest had been touched and she did not say that her breast had been squeezed. On this point, I agreed with the DPP’s submissions in response, that the discrepancy arose from the translation across three languages of English, Vietnamese and Mandarin. I would also add my observation that PW7’s evidence was consistent with V1’s evidence on the material point of whether the Accused had touched V1 on her vagina area, over her underwear.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether V1 had been coached in her evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It was submitted by the Defence that someone had told V1 how to answer when questioned in Court. This submission was based on V1’s response when she was asked if she was told how to answer questions before coming to Court, her response was “I don’t want to answer.” V1 was then asked if she wanted to be asked a question as to who asked her to give answers to the court, she did not want to.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     V1’s responses to the counsel’s probe into whether she had been coached do raise the question of whether her testimony in court was what happened during the incident or had she been coached on what to say.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Prosecution’s response to this suggestion of coaching was that V1 and the rest of the Prosecution witnesses did not know the Accused and had nothing to gain from influencing V1 to falsely implicate the Accused. I agree. Nevertheless, I was mindful of the possibility of V1 having been coached. Other than V1’s unwillingness to answer counsel’s query that someone had told her how to answer questions and who that person might be, there was nothing to point to V1 giving false evidence at the behest of anyone.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The counsel had not probed further by asking her specific questions on which part, if any, of her evidence had been coached. If indeed she was coached, it would not have been difficult for counsel to ask her – a 10-year-old girl facing questions by the DPP and counsel in court – questions to narrow down the scope and specifics of the alleged coaching, if any. By leaving the matter as mere suspicion, did not in my view, provide a proper basis for the court to come to the conclusion that she had been coached or told to fabricate evidence. It certainly was not sufficient to amount to a reasonable doubt on the material evidence given by V1.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The counsel had carried out a thorough cross-examination of V1 on her recollection of the incident. V1 was able to respond to these questions directly, without any hesitation or wavering in her answers. I note nothing in her demeanour, and from the forthright replies given by her, that suggested she was repeating what another person told her to say. I found her answers and the responsive manner of answering, to be based on what she could recollect rather than from being told what to say.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     A significant point to bear in mind is that much of what V1 described, from the time the Accused came down the staircase and pulled her towards him, accorded with what had transpired, as revealed by the undisputed facts. Much of what V1 testified to, also tied in with what the Accused admitted to in court and in his statements to the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For the Accused to suggest through his counsel that V1 had been coached on what to say, and to hint at the possibility that she was specifically told to say that she was touched on her chest and vagina area over her underwear is, in my view, nothing more than a grasping at straws by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Accused had touched V1’s vagina area accidentally</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Accused denied that he had deliberately put his hand under V1’s skirt to touch her underwear and if it had happened, it was an accidental act. The Defence submitted that V1 herself could not say if the action of the Accused was accidental.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I found that the Accused cannot be believed when he suggested that the touching of the lower part of the body of V1 could be accidental. There were material inconsistencies in his evidence as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     In court, the Accused’s position at the start of his testimony was that he <u>had not touched</u> the lower body of V1. In fact, in his cautioned statement to the police – Exhibit D1 – the Accused wrote: “…IT DID NOT HAPPEN AS THE GIRL DID NOT COOPERATE WITH ME. THUS I DID NOT TOUCH THE VICTIM’S CHEST &amp; GROIN AREA.”</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     His position then shifted after being confronted by his police statement (exhibit P18 at A5) in which he said: “…that was where I used my left hand to grab her uniform.” His position progressed to saying that he <u>might have touched</u> her below her skirt but not on her underwear (refer to the Examination-in-chief NE Day 5 page 12 at lines 7 to 28).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     Eventually, the Accused said that <u>it was possible that he had touched</u> her on her vagina area over her underwear (during the cross-examination of the Accused):</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">“Q:    And in attempting to do so, you had used your left hand and grabbed her uniform?</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">A:    Yes, Your Honour.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Q:    Okay. And you’ve indicated also that it’s possible that your hand went under her uniform when you did so.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">A:    Yes, Your Honour.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Q:    And at the same time, it’s also possible that you had touched her vagina area over her underwear.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">A:    Yes, Your Honour.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2"></p> <div align="right"> (NE Day 5 on 20 November 2019 – from Page 36 at 23 to 31) </div> <p></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I accepted the submissions of the Prosecution that the Accused’s “evolving evidence in relation to the nature of the contact reeks of an afterthought. This is especially so given that the Defence of “accidental contact” with the victim’s vagina area was not raised in any of the Accused’s statements, or in his Case for the Defence.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     There was an ancillary hearing carried out to determine the admissibility of the police statements given by the Accused, after he made certain allegations against the Investigation Officer (“IO”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Accused challenged the admissibility of the three police statements P16, P17 and P18 even though the truth of the contents of the statements is not denied. At [7] of the Defence Closing Submissions, it is stated: “The truth of the contents of the statements is not denied.” The Accused’s objections to the admissibility of his police statements was that the IO had induced him to give those statements by allowing him to make calls to his family and had threatened to remand him further if he failed to cooperate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     After conducting the ancillary hearing, I had no doubt that all the police statements were rendered by the Accused voluntarily and were not inadmissible. I agree with the Prosecution that it was a “belated, ill-conceived, desperate attempt to distance himself from the contents of the statements which materially undermined his defence and his credibility”. I accepted the evidence of the IO that he did not threaten the Accused into giving the statements and there was no inducement. The sequence of events surrounding the recording of the statements had been helpfully set out by the DPP at [10] of her submissions at the close of the ancillary hearing. Having regard to the testimonies of the IO and the Accused during the ancillary hearing and for the reasons given by the DPP at (a) to (f) of [11] of her submissions, I concluded that the Accused’s claims of inducement and threats to be devoid of substance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In summary, for the contested charge, there is only one material fact in dispute <em>i.e.</em> whether the Accused touched V1 on her vagina area over her underwear, since the surrounding facts were all admitted. I found V1’s testimony to be cogent and her evidence to be internally and externally consistent. Therefore, the fact in dispute has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the Accused was found guilty of the contested charge in DAC 918768 of 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Admitted Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The charge against the Accused for which he chose to plead guilty was:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>DAC-918249-2018</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    “You, Mohamed Ardlee Iriandee bin Mohamed Sanip, male / 39 years old, are charged that you, on 21 May 2018, at or about 4.00 pm, at the staircase landing at level 2 of [address redacted] did attempt to use criminal force to one [name redacted], female / 10 years old (D.O.B. 18 May 2008), intending to outrage her modesty by touching her chest or her private parts, and in order to facilitate the commission of this offence, you voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to the said [name redacted] by covering her mouth and pulling her towards the staircase landing by holding onto her shoulder, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354A(2)(b) r/w Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Statement of Facts for the Admitted Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The victim (“V2”) was a 10-year-old Primary 4 female student. On 21 May 2018 at about 4 pm, she was returning home in her school uniform after a remedial class. She entered the lift alone on the ground floor of her block of flats where she lived. She and her family resided at a unit on the second floor. When the lift reached the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor and the lift doors opened, V2 saw the Accused in front of her just outside the lift doors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     At this juncture, the Accused placed his hand on the victim’s shoulder and began pushing her towards the staircase landing. As he was doing so, V2 reached the doorway of her unit. She tried to break free and screamed. The Accused covered her mouth with his hand and forcefully pulled the victim towards the corner of the staircase landing area, away from V2’s family unit. V2’s screams were stifled in part due to the Accused covering her mouth with his hand. V2 continued to scream and resisted the Accused’s acts. V2 tried to bend down to weaken the Accused’s grip. The Accused then released V2 and ran down the staircase.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     V2 ran to her unit and told her aunt what had happened. The aunt observed that she was shaking, crying and looked terrified as V2 related the incident to her. The cousins of V2 called for police assistance and searched for the Accused but were unsuccessful. After the incident, V2 feared walking home alone from school for some time and experienced flashbacks of the incident. She now walks home whilst accompanied by a classmate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Accused’s acts were captured by the police cameras at the incident location. The footages showed that the Accused had walked up to the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor and waited for V2 near the lift. After V2 exited the lift, the Accused is seen covering her mouth and pulling her towards the staircase landing by holding onto her shoulder. V2 struggled and tried to bend down to release the grip. The Accused released the victim after 10 seconds and ran down the stairs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     After the case was reported to the police, considerable efforts were undertaken to identify the Accused. The police eventually managed to do so and the Accused was arrested the following day. The Accused admitted that he had driven from his workplace to the vicinity of the incident. Whilst seated in his car, he noticed V2 walking back from school and he began following her from a distance, having formed the intention to outrage her modesty.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Prosecution submitted that a global term of 9 years’ imprisonment and 7 strokes of the cane is justified in this case. The DPP suggested a term of 6 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane be imposed for the contested charge in DAC 918768/2018 and a term of 3 years’ imprisonment and 1 stroke of the cane be imposed for the admitted charge in DAC 918249/2018. Both terms to run consecutively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Defence submitted that only the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment of 3 years for each of the two offences be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for the Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The provision of Section 354A of the Penal Code reads:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>354A.</b>—(1)    Whoever, in order to commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence against any person under section 354, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to that person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death, instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 10 years and with caning.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Whoever commits an offence under subsection (1) —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    in a lift in any building; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    against any person under 14 years of age,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 3 years and not more than 10 years and with caning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The offence under Section 354A(2) has a mandatory minimum imprisonment of not less than 3 years and mandatory caning to be imposed. The punishment of Attempt for such an offence is also a mandatory minimum imprisonment of not less than 3 years and mandatory caning but has an upper limit of imprisonment of 5 years, which is half of the maximum imprisonment term of 10 years. This is as provided for under Section 511 of the Penal Code for the punishment of attempting to commit offences, where no express provision is made by the Penal Code for the punishment of such attempts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The dominant sentencing principle in this case is Deterrence. Both General and Specific Deterrence are engaged. The other sentencing principles of Retribution and Protection of the Public are also applicable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Accused began developing an interest in stories about “molestation” and “paedophile” in December 2017 when he first chanced upon them on Yahoo News. He began to search online for pictures of young girls and found a website called “Naturist”. He admitted to being sexually aroused by the photos of the young girls on “Naturist” and to have masturbated to them. He added that the ages of these young girls ranged from 10 to 16 years old and that some of these girls were pre-pubescent. According to the IMH psychiatrist, he likely suffers from <em>Paedophilic Disorder</em> (<em>nonexclusive type</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Accused is a first offender but the offences he had committed were very serious. The offences were committed on victims who were young schoolgirls. They were on their way home after school. The punishment would have to be severe enough to reflect the condemnation of such acts committed against the highly vulnerable victims. It is clear, that there was premeditation and the Accused was fully aware of what he was doing in the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I began my consideration of the appropriate sentences by calibrating the sentence for the admitted charge in DAC 918249/2018. The starting point is the mandatory minimum imprisonment of 3 years. I bore in mind that the Accused had pleaded guilty to this charge. Although the Prosecution would have no difficulty in proving the offence against the Accused as the crime was clearly captured on CCTV, there was mitigating value in sparing the child victim from having to testify in court and reliving the ordeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Accused was a first offender but it could not be ignored that the attempted offence was committed in May 2018, four months after the first offence committed on V1 in January 2018. Nevertheless, I did not find it necessary to go beyond the mandatory minimum imprisonment of 3 years for the admitted charge and 2 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     For the conviction on the contested charge, I took into account the following factors in calibrating the sentence:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_a"></a>a.     V1 was 8 years old at the time of the offence, which is significantly lower than the 14 years of victims for offences under Section 354A(2)(b) Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_b"></a>b.     Offence was committed with premeditation. The Accused had targeted schoolgirls and chose areas around primary schools to look for his victims.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_c"></a>c.     The Accused is a diagnosed paedophile with at least a moderate risk of re-offending, as assessed by Dr Lee Kim Huat in his report dated 13 May 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_d"></a>d.     Lack of remorse and subjecting V2 to re-live the traumatic event.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_e"></a>e.     Intrusion of the private part of the young girl by touching her vagina area over her underwear.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     These factors called for an uplift from the mandatory minimum imprisonment of 3 years and an appropriate number of strokes of the cane. The full range of imprisonment is from 3 years to 10 years. The Prosecution submitted for 6 years and 6 strokes. I was not convinced that an uplift to twice the mandatory minimum of 3 years would be justified bearing in mind that the molest was not skin to skin and lasted not more than 15 seconds. An uplift of one and a half years to 4 years and 6 months would be reasonable. Together with caning of 4 strokes, the sentence would serve its deterrent and retributive effects.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     For the aforesaid reasons, I passed the following sentences to be run consecutively:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>DAC 918768/2018</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_"></a>-    4 years and 6 months of imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>DAC 918249/2018</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2__1"></a>-    3 years' imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_"></a>The total sentence is imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months (or 90 months in total) and caning of 6 strokes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It is obvious that the two sentences should run consecutively as they were committed on two different victims on two different days, about four months apart. I agree with the DPP that to run the sentences concurrently would result in a perverse outcome – in that he would not be punished for committing a further offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Accused is a paedophile and should be incarcerated for a significant period of time to protect our young vulnerable schoolgirls. Despite being a commissioned officer of the Singapore Armed Forces, which is an organisation sworn to protect the security of our nation, the Accused had spent his time researching on how to harm young girls and proceeded to carry out the heinous acts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It is only to avoid over-punishment that the Court had restrained itself from imposing a longer sentence asked for by the Prosecution. It is hoped that the substantial sentence of seven and a half years of imprisonment and the 6 strokes of caning would be significantly sufficient to turn the Accused, who is a first offender, away from his paedophilic inclination when he is released from prison in 5 years’ time under the Conditional Release System currently in place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     A brief coda: In the event that the appellate court is of the view that the aforesaid Findings at [15] to [32] are not sufficient to show that the testimony of V1 is unusually convincing and should not lead to the conviction of the Accused on the charge in DAC 918768/2018 for the offence of Outrage of Modesty with wrongful restraint of V1, the Accused would nevertheless be guilty of the offence of Attempted Outrage of Modesty with wrongful restraint of V1 and would have to be punished with at least three years of imprisonment and mandatory caning under Section 354A(2)(b) read with Section 511 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     At [135] of the Defence Closing Submissions, it is stated: “The Accused has been consistent with his defence that although he was on the [address redacted] on 22<sup>nd</sup> January 2018 with the <em>mens rea</em> of wanting to molest the victim, he was not able to carry (out) his intention due to the resistance and struggling of the victim.” Also at [42] of the Defence’s Reply, it was submitted on behalf of the Accused: “While it is not disputed that the Accused had the <em>mens rea</em> or intent to commit the act of molesting on a young girl, he was not able to carry out his said intention to touch the vagina area of the victim although there was an act of pulling the victim’s left hand to the staircase area. The element of the <em>actus reus</em> was missing as the Accused ran off before the act (of molest) took place.”</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap5 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
