class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused, Mohammad Haris Bin Mohammad Ali, is a 23-year-old male Singaporean. He was formerly a customer service associate in the employ of SATS Asia Pacific Star Pte Ltd (“SATS APS”). The accused was charged with committing an offence under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 (“the PCA”). His charge reads:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You… charged that you, on not less than 3 occasions between April and May 2018, in Singapore, being an agent, <em>to wit</em>, a Customer Service Associate in the employ of SATS Asia Pacific Star Pte Ltd, did embark on a course of corruptly accepting from one Ahmad, gratification for yourself in the form of at least 6 packets of ‘Winston’ cigarettes amounting to about S$66, as a reward for doing an act in relation to your principal’s affairs, <em>to wit</em>, under-reporting the weight of passenger baggage in the check-in computer system for passengers checking in for flights on Scoot Tigerair Pte Ltd., and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Prosecution’s case consisted essentially of evidence from a SATS APS representative, and admissions contained in the accused’s own statements. After his defence was called, the accused was the only witness who testified.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Subsequently, after examining the notes of evidence (NE), the exhibits, and the submissions from the Prosecution and the Defence, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proved the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted the accused accordingly. Thereafter, following sentencing submissions from the Prosecution and a brief oral mitigation plea, I sentenced the accused to 2 weeks’ imprisonment, and also imposed a penalty of $66 (in default one day’s imprisonment).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal. I now give the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the Prosecution’s Evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The evidence adduced by the Prosecution is summarised below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s statement P1 recorded by PW1 Senior Special Investigator Ms Ng Yu Hui (SSI Ng) </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Prosecution sought to tender the accused’s long statement P1 recorded by SSI Ng of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). While the Defence did not dispute that the statement was given voluntarily, the accuracy of the statement was disputed. After hearing from both the Prosecution and the Defence on the question of whether there was any need to conduct an ancillary hearing in light of the dispute over the accuracy of the statement P1, I decided to do so in line with the guidance of Chan Seng Onn J in <em>Public Prosecutor v Parthiban Kanapathy</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23620-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGHC 226</a> (“<em>Parthiban</em>”). In this regard, at [33] of <em>Parthian</em>, Justice Chan had stated the following:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    It makes good sense that an ancillary hearing ought to be called when the accuracy and/or authenticity of a statement is being challenged, even if the accused does not explicitly challenge the voluntariness and/or admissibility of the said statement.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">SSI Ng testified that P1 was accurately recorded</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       SSI Ng testified that the CPIB had arrested the accused at his home at 6 am on 25th September 2018. Following the arrest of the accused, she had recorded his statement at the interview room 3-31 at 12.40 pm. Only she and the accused were present during the statement recording process.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       SSI Ng said that the accused spoke to her in English when giving his statement, and that she and the accused were able to understand each other. The accused also did not ask for any clarification during the recording process. SSI Ng explained that she recorded the accused’s statement by asking the accused questions, and then typing in the accused’s answers. At the end of the process, SSI Ng printed out the statement for the accused to read it himself, and for him to make the amendments that he wished.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       SSI Ng said that the accused then made amendments at the cover page where she had missed out the accused’s marital status and his email address. Further, the accused had cancelled out the word “them” at paragraph 10, the word “why” at paragraph 11, and at paragraph 29, he had cancelled out “during” and an extra “the”.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> When questioned by counsel, SSI Ng denied that the accused had made these amendments because she had told him to read the statement and to only look out for any grammatical error or English mistake. Instead, SSI Ng said that after she had printed out the statement, she had given the accused a pen and told him that he could make any amendment that he liked.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span><sup></sup> SSI Ng further testified that after the accused had finished making the amendments, he had signed at the end of the statement and at the bottom right-hand corner of every page.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As regards the various incriminating contents and admissions in the accused’s statement, SSI Ng disagreed with counsel that these were not matters stated by the accused. Specifically, she disagreed that the following sentences and paragraphs in P1 were not said by the accused:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     At paragraph 25, where it was recorded that the accused had stated: “It was only from then that I started receiving a packet of cigarette from him for helping him”.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The first line at paragraph 28, where it was recorded that the accused had said: “If I saw Ahmad during my afternoon shift at the check-in counter, I would help him with 3 passengers on average per afternoon shift and I work around 5 days a week on average”.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     The whole of paragraph 29, where it was recorded that the accused had stated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">On average, Ahmad would pass me 2 packets of cigarettes a week. Therefore, he had given me at least 6 packets of cigarettes in total from mid April to early May across around 3 weeks. The last time I helped him should be the week of 5<sup>th </sup>May as I remember that that day was my colleague's wedding day and I had taken a 1 week break after the wedding before I started only working the night shift.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     With regard to paragraph 30, and the answer, A1 which reads:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">A1: Yes, Ahmad had given me cigarettes in return for keying in the weight that is within the baggage allowance the passenger accompanied by him has. However, I did not get anything from him in the beginning. Initially, I had helped him as I did not want to fill in the excess baggage slips and also wanted to clear the queue quickly so that I could go for my break and I did not get anything in return for helping him. However, he later offered to give me cigarettes which I did not reject since I was already helping him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     SSI Ng further clarified that the accused did not make any request or complaint before, during or after the statement recording, and that no threat, inducement or promise was made to him. In addition, SSI Ng said that before recording the statement from the accused, they had only received information that some check-in staff were allowing their passengers to bring in excess baggage but not keying accurately into the system. But SSI Ng did not know exact details such as who was given the gratification, or the nature of it i.e. whether the gratification was in the form of money or in other forms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Accused’s claim that his statement was inaccurately recorded</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     When the accused testified at the ancillary hearing, he confirmed that his statement was recorded by SSI Ng on 25 September 2018 at 12.40 pm, and that this occurred after he was arrested at his home at about 6.00 am, and brought to the CPIB. He said that this was the first time he had ever been arrested.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At the CPIB, he was provided with breakfast before SSI Ng came to the interview room, introduced herself, asked for his name, and told him she wanted to record his statement. She then started to interview him and ask him questions, although she did not tell him what questions she wanted to ask him, or what they were going to be about. The accused said that he does not recall if SSI Ng had asked if he needed an interpreter, but he admitted that he did not request for an interpreter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The accused also said that SSI Ng had asked him about his previous job as a check-in staff at SATS APS, where he had worked in early 2018 for about 4 to 5 months. Further, SSI Ng had showed him a video of what she wanted to ask him. According to the accused, the video showed him checking in one passenger, and an Indian guy who was trying to cut queue. The accused said that SSI Ng had then told him that he had under-keyed the baggage allowance, but the accused had denied this.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     When shown his statement P1, the accused said that paragraphs 1-8 of P1 were about him and his previous job at SATS APS, including about how he checked in passengers, what he does at the counter, how he was trained to check the luggage, how much was the excess baggage cost, and about the repacking of luggage. The accused then made comments about the following parts of P1:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Paragraph 25 which mentions about a person “Ahmad”: the accused said that he had told SSI Ng that he got the cigarettes from Ahmad, but claimed that he did not say that he had helped Ahmad.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     Paragraph 28: the accused said that SSI Ng had asked him how many times Ahmad came to his counter with the passengers, and he had told her that it was about 3 times a day, but that all their baggage was within the weight limit. The accused further explained that for the check-in process, if a passenger had bought luggage allowance for 20 kg, the luggage should weigh 20 kg only, with a grace allowance of 1 to 2 kilograms. So if the luggage was overweight, the passenger would need to repack it, and then come back to the counter afterwards.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     Paragraph 29: the accused said that he was asked about how many cigarettes that he got, and he had said that this was about 2 packets a week. The accused said that SSI Ng had also asked him about when he stopped receiving the cigarettes and he had told her that it was after his colleague’s wedding when he started doing night shift.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     Paragraph 30: the accused said that he had told SSI Ng that he did get some cigarettes, but this was not because he had assisted Ahmad but because he wanted to clear the queue so that he could end his work early. Thus, he insisted that the answer recorded by SSI Ng as to the reason why he received the cigarettes from Ahmad was not accurate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On being cross-examined, the accused confirmed that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     He was only disputing the accuracy of paragraphs 25, 28, 29 and answer 1 of paragraph 30, and not the rest of his statement P1.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     He also said that he had 15 minutes to read through the statement and to make any amendment that he wanted. Despite this, he did not make any amendment to the paragraphs above which he claimed were not accurate, even though he did make amendments to other parts of his statement. He also admitted that he could have amended paragraphs, 25, 28, 29, and 30 A1 if he had wanted to, and that SSI Ng did not stop him from making any amendment to P1 that he wanted.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     However, the accused later claimed that he had not made the amendments because SSI Ng had just asked him to find the mistakes, and he “…just scanned through and he did not read to understand.” Instead, the accused claimed that he was just looking for spelling and grammar mistakes, since SSI Ng never asked him to go through the statement to check on its accuracy.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     The accused admitted that he is able to understand English, and communicate with other people in English. He also admitted that he had in fact, spoken in English a few times in court to the interpreter. Thus, when SSI Ng was recording the statement P1 from him, the accused was able to communicate with her in English, they both understood each other, and he had no difficulty communicating with her during the statement recording process.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a>(e)     Finally, the accused admitted that he had given his statement voluntarily.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As for the contents at paragraph 25 of his statement P1, the accused agreed that the information could not have come from SSI Ng since she did not know about the details of his case, such as the name of the giver and the nature of the gratification before she recorded P1 from him. Despite this, he disagreed that all the information in paragraph 25 came from him, and insisted that SSI Ng may have added in the part of the statement where it was stated that he had assisted Ahmad.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The accused further said that he had told SSI Ng that he had received cigarettes from Ahmad but that this was not because he had helped Ahmad. Instead, the accused said: “I’ve never accepted cigarette from Ahmad for helping him. I never helped him at all, so why do I need to expect anything from him?” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The accused further claimed that he just told SSI Ng that he accepted the cigarettes because they are expensive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Further, the accused insisted that he did not help Ahmad. When it was then pointed out to him that he had mentioned in paragraph 20 of P1 that he had helped Ahmad out of pity, and that in paragraph 21 he had also mentioned that he had helped Ahmad’s passenger, the accused backtracked and claimed that both paragraphs 20 and 21, which he had previously not said were inaccurate, were actually also inaccurate.<sup></sup>It was then further pointed out to him that in paragraph 30 A2, he had also mentioned about helping Ahmad, and the accused agreed that he had earlier confirmed that this part of his statement was accurate. He further conceded that there were multiple references in his statement P1 where he had admitted to helping Ahmad.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Subsequently, when questioned about his answer in paragraph 30 A1, where he had allegedly told SSI Ng that he did get some cigarettes not because he assisted Ahmad, but because he had wanted to clear the queue so that he could end his work early, the accused agreed that Ahmad has no reason to give him cigarettes for clearing the queue. He, however, continued to insist that he did his work to clear the queue and not for the cigarettes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Finally, the accused confirmed that he had not met SSI Ng or any of the other CPIB officers before the date of his arrest, which was also the date that his statement P1 was recorded from him.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Admitting P1 into evidence: voluntariness and accuracy </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I deal now with the issue of whether the accused’s statement P1 should be admitted into evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At the onset, I note that it was not disputed that P1 was voluntarily recorded, and there was no allegation that any threat, inducement or promise had been made to the accused in connection with the recording of this statement.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As for the claim made by the accused that P1 should not be admitted and/or relied on because it was not an accurate statement, I rejected this argument, since the allegations of inaccuracy and/or of impropriety in the statement recording process were clearly not borne out. Instead, there was compelling evidence that the statement P1 contained an accurate account of what the accused had told SSI Ng, which she had faithfully recorded in documentary form. I came to this conclusion for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, as regards the recording of P1, it was clear from SSI Ng’s evidence, and the evidence of the accused himself, that both of them had spoken to one another in English during the statement recording process, and that they had no problems understanding each other. SSI Ng had recorded what the accused had said to her, and she had also given him the opportunity, after the statement was printed out, to make any amendment that he wished to make to the statement. The accused had indeed taken this opportunity to make several amendments found at the cover page, and at paragraphs 10, 11 and 29, but he had left unchanged parts of the statement, which he now alleges were inaccurate accounts of what he had said, in particular, paragraphs 25, 28, 29, and 30 A1. However, I found it hard to believe this belated claim by the accused of the inaccuracy of these recorded paragraphs, since he had admitted that SSI Ng did not stop him from making any amendment that he wanted to P1 at the end of the statement recording process.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     In addition, there was also no suggestion that the accused had failed to understand the contents of P1 when he was given the opportunity to read through it, or that he was rushed into signing it and hence missed out on these material inaccuracies when he read through his statement P1 before signing.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     Further, while the accused claimed that he had only made changes to P1 to correct grammatical errors or English mistakes, allegedly because these were the only things that SSI Ng asked him to look out for when checking through P1, I rejected his claim. In this regard, not only was this bare claim firmly refuted by SSI Ng on the stand, SSI Ng also made it clear that she had given the accused the opportunity to make any amendment that he wished.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     More importantly, there was no dispute that the accused was given a chance to read through his statement, and since he had to, and did, sign his statement at the last page to “confirm it to be true and correct”, I could hardly accept that he would be so focussed on, and be actively looking out for typographical errors only, rather than in making sure that the substantive contents of P1 were actually “true and correct”, which was something that he needed to affirm and sign at the last page of P1. This was especially so since there was admittedly no inducement, threat or promise made by SSI Ng or anyone else to him, and there was no evidence that the accused was in any way so intimidated by the recording environment that he would have missed out correcting the damning admissions in P1 that he would have read before signing it.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     Moreover, it should be noted that the accused was brought to the CPIB from his home in the early morning o 25 September 2018, for the purpose of investigations that he presumably would have known was connected with a corruption matter. In such circumstances, it could hardly be the case that the accused would be focussed on making unimportant changes such as correcting grammatical and English mistakes, when the statement contained major admissions made by him about his receiving rewards for showing favours to Ahmad. He would instead have corrected these material admissions, if they were indeed inaccurate accounts of what he had said, or if they had been mistakenly recorded by SSI Ng.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_f"></a>(f)     All in all, the only plausible explanation why the accused signed on his voluntary statement P1, after making the corrections that he wished, was because it contained exactly what he had said to SSI Ng in the first place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I would add that while counsel suggested that SSI Ng had unliterally inserted into P1 matters that were not stated by the accused, all of which were incriminating to the accused, I did not accept this allegation of such impropriety on SSI Ng’s part. For one, it was not disputed by the Defence that SSI Ng did not know important details of the accused’s case, such as the name of the giver and the nature of the gratification before she recorded P1 from the accused. Hence, such information had to have come from the accused, including information which he now alleges were inaccurately recorded from him. Moreover, since SSI Ng was not known to the accused prior to the recording of P1 on 25 September 2018, there was no reason for her to have fabricated the incriminating contents in P1 against him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In any event, in assessing the claims made by the accused about the alleged inaccuracies in P1, I also considered the evidence given by the accused, and found him to be a witness of little credit. In this regard, I noted that the accused kept changing his evidence on the stand, in the course of the ancillary hearing, from first claiming that only paragraphs, 25, 28, 29, and 30 A1 were inaccurate and that the rest of the statement was accurate, to later insisting that paragraph 20 and then also paragraph 21 were inaccurate as well. The further claims of inaccuracy were only made, after he was confronted with the fact that the contents of these paragraphs, contradicted his testimony that he did not help Ahmad. However, the accused was later forced to concede that in various parts of P1, all of which he had earlier testified were accurate, he had similarly admitted that to have helped Ahmad, a position again at odds with what he said in court. Suffice to say, the accused’s constant vacillation on this important issue suggested that he was changing his evidence as he went along, simply to present a position that he felt was most advantageous to him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In short, in light of the procedures followed, and the precautions adopted by SSI Ng in the recording of P1, and her consistent and convincing evidence that she accurately recorded what the accused had said, especially when compared to the accused’s constantly changing account of the process, as well as his own admission that P1 was voluntarily given and that he was afforded the opportunity to make amendments to his statement, I was satisfied that P1 was both a voluntary statement, and one that accurately contained what the accused had told SSI Ng on 25 September 2018. Accordingly, I admitted P1 into evidence, and found it to be a piece of evidence that I could rely on.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I would add that following the ancillary hearing, and in the course of testifying during the main trial, the accused admitted that he had signed on P1 only after he had understood it and confirmed it to be true and correct.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This fortified my conclusion that P1 contained an accurate account of what he had said to SSI Ng.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I will discuss the relevant contents of P1 at a later part of this judgment when considering whether the elements of the charge were made out.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence from the accused’s superior at SATS APS: Ms Herlina </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Following the ancillary hearing, PW2 Ms. Herlina Suryani (“Ms Herlina”), a senior manager of passenger services at SATS, gave evidence. Ms Herlina, who oversees the Passenger Services Department for SATS APS, explained that the department deals with check-in and passenger handling.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     She said that the accused, who was employed by SATS APS from 19 October 2017, signed a letter of acceptance when he was first employed. On this letter (P2) were attached the terms and conditions of employment as well as the company’s Code of Conduct (COC). Paragraph 6 of the COC deals with what an employee is expected to do when in receipt of employment-related gifts, and for tipping. According to paragraph 6 of the COC, if a SATS APS staff assigned to duties at the check-in counter were to accept gifts in exchange for declaring a lower baggage weight than the actual weight, this paragraph would be contravened since this states that employees are not supposed to receive any payment or gift in kind in relation to their employment with SATS APS.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Ms Herlina confirmed that the accused had signed on the bottom right portion of each page of the COC for his employment. When questioned by counsel, Ms Herlina agreed that the prohibition against accepting gifts does not apply to gifts exchanged in a personal capacity between friends, where those gifts do not relate to the employee’s employment with the company, and where the gifts do not disrupt “the working of the staff.” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>She, however, disagreed with counsel’s interpretation that the tipping referred to in the COC only applies to monetary gifts, and said that tipping could be in cash or a gift in kind.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Ms Herlina explained that when the accused first joined SATS APS, he was required to undergo training before starting work. Specifically, he attended a course titled “APS induction”, which was a course to brief the staff about the overall company structure, housekeeping matters, and the company’s COC. The accused had signed on an attendance sheet (P4) to indicate his attendance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Ms Herlina also referred to an extract of a set of PowerPoint slides titled “Code of Conduct” (P5), which she clarified was for a module within the induction programme. She explained that if an APS staff assigned to duties at the check-in counter were to accept gifts in exchange for declaring a lower baggage weight than the actual weight, this would also contravene paragraph 13 under the header, “Tipping”, where it was specifically stated that “Staff is prohibited from soliciting, demanding and accepting tips from the travelling public, customers, consignees or agents”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In addition, there was another course, titled “Getting Yourself Operational Ready”, which the accused had attended as indicated on the attendance sheet that he had signed (P6). This course was to brief new staff about administrative and housekeeping matters, the organisational structure, and about what to do or not to do before they started work. Based on an extract of the briefing slides that was used for this course (P7), Ms Herlina said that if an APS staff who was assigned duties at the check-in counter accepted gifts in exchange for declaring a lower baggage weight than the actual weight, this action would contravene the House Rules referred to in the slide relating to the “Receipt and Giving of Employment Related Gifts/Tipping”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Ms Herlina also gave evidence about the accused’s duty as an APS staff deployed to carry out check-in duties. She said that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     A check-in staff is required to ensure that the passenger has valid travel documents, and if the passenger has check-in baggage, the staff is required to weigh the check-in baggage and to check the system to see whether the weight of the baggage was within the purchased limit. If a passenger came with baggage that exceeded his purchased limit allowance, the staff has to ask the passenger if he wanted to proceed to check in the bag or to repack.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the passenger choses to check in the bag, then the staff needs to advise the passenger about the excess baggage charge that he has to pay. After that, the staff would issue a passenger with the excess baggage form with the details of the total excess weight and the charge that has to be paid. He then has to direct the passenger to the service desk for the passenger to make payment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     Further, the check-in staff was supposed to key into the system the actual weight of the passenger’s baggage. If the check-in staff was to key in a value for the baggage weight that was lower than the actual baggage weight, that would be violating the SOP, and would cause a loss of revenue for the airline. In addition, if the information captured in the system about the baggage weight was inaccurate, this would affect the trimming of the whole aircraft i.e. its weight and balance which, in turn, could have percussions on the safety of the aircraft, and that of the passengers on that flight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Ms Herlina also tendered a summary of the excess baggage charge rates for 2018 that applied for different sectors (P9). She revealed that as the accused tendered to work in the evenings when the Indian flights for Scoot Airlines operated, the excess baggage rates for this airline was $60 for a 20 kg baggage allowance, and $20 per kg for excess baggage. Ms Herlina said that the recording of the weight of the baggage in the system was in the hands of the staff and was not computerised in that the weight was not recorded in the system automatically. She said that they do not check what their staff key into the system, although they do have duty supervisors who would walk their rounds.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the case of a check-in agent, Ms Herlina said that it was not permissible for a passenger, who is his friend, to give the agent something in exchange for under-declaring the passenger’s check-in baggage weight. Thus, if the gift was intended for something in relation to the staff’s work, even if it was given outside of the employee’s working hours, this was not allowed. This was the case so long as it was given in relation to the staff’s employment with the company.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Ms Herlina also referred to a termination letter from SATS APS dated 26th July 2018 that was addressed to the accused to inform hm that his service with the company was terminated with effect from that date (P3). Ms Herlina explained that the accused’s termination was effected in relation to his suspected involvement with touting activities at the airport, even though this was not stated in his termination letter. She explained that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    What I understand from touting is a certain individual will then approach, uh, passengers at the airport who have, um, excess baggage issues, um, to pull the luggage or---or, yah, in or---or rather to pull the luggage or to offer, uh, cheaper rate---excess baggage rate compared to what the passengers have to pay officially at the airport.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Further, following a tip-off from a newspaper, the company had conducted internal investigations, reviewed CCTV footage, and made a police report thereafter. She further testified that as far as she was aware, the accused has never declared to SATS APS the receipt of any gift by him. If he had done so, she would have been aware of it. In fact, to her knowledge, since she started working for SATS APS in September 2017, no staff has ever declared the acceptance of any gifts.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the Defence’s Evidence : Accused’s account </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, as there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible and which satisfied each and every element of the charge, I called on the accused to give his defence. He elected to take the stand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The accused testified that he started working part-time at SATS APS from the end of 2017, as a customer service associate dealing with passenger handling. His job involved checking in passengers and their luggage.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The accused said that for passengers that go to his counter, he would have to check their passports and that they had booked a flight. He would then check them in and weigh their luggage to ensure that the weight did not exceed the weight limit. The allowance for each passenger would be reflected in the check-in system and the boarding flight ticket.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The accused testified that the grace allowance for the luggage was one kilogram, and that beyond this limit, he would ask the passenger to repack the luggage or to pay for the excess luggage weight as per the allowance rates set out in P9. After paying for the excess weight, the bags would be released at the conveyor belt, and be brought to the cargo site.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The accused admitted that when he was working at Changi Airport as a customer service associate for SATS APS, he knew that it was wrong to key in a lower baggage weight than the actual baggage weight, and that he had been briefed on the proper procedure to follow. He agreed that the contents of paragraphs 10 to 14 of his statement P1 reflected the correct procedure for checking in passengers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As for paragraph 15 of his statement P1, where he had mentioned about keying in of the luggage weight, the accused confirmed that before June 2018, whenever the luggage was weighed at the counter during check-in, the customer service associate would need to manually key in the weight into the system. After June 2018, the system was changed such that the customer service associate no longer had to manually key in the weight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The accused said that he stopped working at the airport around mid-June 2018 when he took a break. He was subsequently given a termination letter stating his last day of work to be 26<sup>th</sup> July 2018, and that his salary would be paid up to that date. The accused claimed that he did not know the reason why his employment was terminated, and that he was surprised at the termination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On 25 September 2018, CPIB officers had gone to his house. However, they did not inform him of the reason for asking him to go to CPIB.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     When asked about the person “Ahmad”, the accused described Ahmad as an Indian or Bangladeshi national because of his skin colour, and said that Ahmad was about 30 years of age. He had met Ahmad at the smoking corner at the airport, and he also sometimes saw Ahmad at the check-in counter area. He said that they had casual conversations in English at the smoking corner and that these conversations had nothing to do with work. At their second or third meeting, Ahmad had asked the accused if he wanted a cigarette and the accused had said ok.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The accused testified that he had met Ahmad about 2 to 3 times a week, but that aside from seeing Ahmad at the airport, he did not meet Ahmad at any other place because they did not contact each other. They also did not have any other interaction besides these conversations at the airport. The accused said that he had been friends with Ahmad for only about a month. When questioned by the Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP), the accused said that when he first met Ahmad, neither of them had asked for the other’s name, and that it was Ahmad who decided to chit chat and be friendly with him. It was then that Ahmad had told the accused his name and also asked the accused for his name. However, they did not exchange phone numbers and the accused did not ask Ahmad where he was from. Neither did the accused ask anything about Ahmad’s personal life.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The accused admitted that Ahmad had given him six packs of Winston brand cigarettes between April and May 2018. Each packet of cigarettes costs about $11 to $12. At that time, the accused was earning about $700 a month, and the cigarettes were given to the accused at the smoking corner. Whenever Ahmad gave the accused a packet of cigarettes, Ahmad would ask for one or two sticks of cigarettes back from the accused and then leave. The accused does not know what Ahmad did with those sticks, but he has not seen Ahmad smoke in front of him. However, the accused said that he assumed that Ahmad was a smoker since he had asked for these sticks of cigarettes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The accused said that his interactions with Ahmad at the smoking corner were very superficial, and that Ahmad had given him the cigarettes as a friendly gesture. He admitted that while Ahmad had given hm gifts, the accused himself had never spent any money on Ahmad, nor did the accused give Ahmad anything except for the one or two sticks of cigarettes that Ahmad asked for.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The accused admitted that he had attended the course on SATS APS’s COC as part of his induction programme (shown in the slides P5), and also the course on “Getting yourself to be operational ready” (shown in the slides P7) before he started work. As for the statement in P7 that “Employees, including their spouse, children or any other relatives, are prohibited from accepting gifts or giving gifts in cash or kind from/to any member of the public…arising from their employment with SATS”, the accused admitted that the reference to “gift” does not necessarily mean that it has to be cash.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, he said that the example given during training was of monetary gifts, although he conceded that gifts could include items other than cash.<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The accused further said that the cigarettes that he received from Ahmad were not really gifts but were given as a friendly gesture. He disagreed that his receipt of the cigarettes was in breach of the SATS APS’s COC. Nevertheless, he knew that it was wrong for him as a customer service associate to receive gifts from members of public in exchange for doing something that only SATS APS employees could do, and that he was supposed to report if someone tried to give him gifts. He was also to decline the gift.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> In addition, the accused admitted that he did not decline the cigarettes that Ahmad offered to him, nor did he report them to his superior. However, his position was that “…a cigarette is just a cigarette…”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The accused testified that when Ahmad came to the check-in counter, he would be sending off his friends. Aside from accompanying them, the accused said that Ahmad did nothing else. The accused also said that he would see Ahmad about 1 to 3 times a day at the check-in counter. The accused said that he had never asked Ahmad why he was always there sending off so many friends, as this was none of his business.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The accused further said that when he first started working there, he had made sure to follow the proper procedure and ensured that the passengers that he checked in would pay for the excess baggage. When questioned about his practice with Ahmad, where he had stated in paragraph 18 of his statement P1 that Ahmad had approached him and said “Please, please” to the accused when the latter approached a passenger with baggage that was overweighed by 5 to 6 kg, the accused denied that he had not followed proper procedure, even though it was stated at paragraph 18 of P1 that he had let the passenger check in without making him pay for the excess baggage.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Instead, the accused claimed that the passenger had been booked by an agent with a group booking reference, and that members of that group shared their baggage allowance, since not all the passengers in that group checked in their full baggage allowance. Thus, the accused claimed that it was okay for him to let those passengers check in their excess baggage without making them pay. The accused further claimed that when Ahmad came to the counter, there were about 3 to 4 persons in the same booking reference. However, he admitted that at paragraph 18 of his statement P1, there was no mention about Ahmad’s passenger having a group booking reference.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     When queried as to why the accused had stated at paragraph 20 of his statement P1 that: “Ahmad was now always looking for me and I did not want to help him all the time and he was irritating me”, the accused said that he felt irritated with Ahmad because he kept bringing passengers who had excess baggage. However, the accused denied that the real reason why he was irritated was because Ahmad was making him do something that he was not supposed to do i.e. to key in a lower baggage weight for these passengers with excess baggage instead of the actual baggage weight. Instead, the accused maintained that Ahmad did not ask him to do anything, and insisted that he had used the group booking baggage limit for the passenger that Ahmad brought to him so that the latter did not need to not pay the excess baggage fee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     When confronted with his cautioned statement (P10)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>, the accused admitted that nowhere in his cautioned statement did he mention anything about under-declaration being done because of the group booking situation. Neither was this claim made in the Case for the Defence (P11) that was filed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submissions by Parties</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Outline of the Prosecution’s Submissions </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Prosecution arguments were set out in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions (PCS). In arguing that the accused acted corruptly, the Prosecution made the following submissions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     First, the accused’s confessions in P1 should be given full weight as they were part of a voluntary statement P1. The evidence established that P1 had been properly recorded, and the accused had also been given the opportunity to make the amendments that he wished to P1.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Second, the essence of the confessions contained P1 was that he had acted corruptly in receiving the cigarettes from Ahmad as he had admitted that he understood that Ahmad had given him cigarettes in return for allowing Ahmad’s passengers to check in overweight baggage without paying excess baggage fees.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Third, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s testimony should be disbelieved where it was inconsistent with his statement P1, in particular on two material issues, namely: (a) what Ahmad was doing at the accused’s check-in counter and whether Ahmad had spoken to the accused there; and (b) whether the accused had helped Ahmad’s passengers check in overweight baggage without paying excess baggage fees.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Finally, when the accused accepted the cigarettes from Ahmad, he was aware that this was disallowed by his employer.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Outline of the Defence’s Submissions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The crux of the Defence’s submissions was that the SATS APS’s prohibition against receipt of gifts by employees did not apply to gifts exchanged between relatives or personal friends of their employees. In this case, counsel stated that the accused had met Ahmad in March 2018, and “ Ahmad always brought passengers to the airport and often they were dealt with by the Accused. Due to the regularity of their meeting they became acquaintances.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Counsel also stated that as the accused and Ahmad subsequently met at the smoking area, sometime in April 2018, Ahmad gave the accused “….a pocket of "Winston" cigarettes. As they are friends, the Accused took the packet of cigarettes. Later on there were a few other occasions when they met at the smoking area and Ahmad had given the accused a packet of "Winston" cigarettes. They have become friends and the Accused had taken the cigarettes as a friendly gesture form [<em>sic</em>] a friend”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Further, counsel argued that the 6 packets of cigarettes, at about $11 each, were of “token value”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In addition, he submitted that: “Sometimes when the passengers arrive at the airport by "group booking" then their luggages [<em>sic</em>] are weighted and the 1 kg grace can be exercised as a group. That means any luggage weighing less than the limit the less weight can be transferred to another luggage in the group that weigh more than the 1kg grace allowed. This can be done so long as the total weight of luggages [<em>sic</em>] in the group do [<em>sic</em>] not exceed the total grace allowed for all the luggages [<em>sic</em>] in the group. This is a common practice by all the staff working for SATS and it is a practice that is allowed by the Management of SATS.” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Further, counsel again took issue with the accuracy of the statement recording process, and he repeated the argument that the recorder had only asked the accused to check for grammatical errors in the statement, and had denied the incriminating contents at paragraphs 25, 29 and 30 of the statement where the accused was recorded to having admitted to receipt of (at least) 6 packets of cigarettes from Ahmad “… as a token of appreciation for [his] help with keying in a weight that is within the passenger's baggage allowance when their baggages were overweight.” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Finally, counsel took issue with the fact that Ahmad was not called as a witness in the trial even though counsel alleged that “(i)It would have been easy for the Prosecution to produce Ahmad as a witness but they have not given any explanation why Ahmad is not produced as a witness”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Outline of Prosecution’s Reply</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Prosecution set out its response to the Defence’s submissions in its Prosecution Closing Submissions (Reply). In essence, the Prosecution took issue with the fact that several arguments were advanced by the Defence without any evidential basis. The response of the Prosecution is summarised below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     First, the accused’s claims that he and Ahmad were friends, and that Ahmad had given him the cigarettes out of friendship, were not proven. In fact, these claims were contradicted by the accused’s confessions in his voluntary statement P1, as well as his evidence in court. At best, the two of them could be said to be acquaintances. Further, rather than having been given the cigarettes out of friendship, the accused had admitted in paragraph 30 A1 of P1 that Ahmad gave him cigarettes for keying in a weight within the passenger’s baggage allowance when the bags were actually overweight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Second, the accused’s claim that he had checked in Ahmad’s passengers under a group booking, and thus utilised the baggage allowance of other passengers to offset the excess weight of individual passengers, was a lie. This claim was never mentioned in his long statement P1, his cautioned statement P10, the Case for the Defence P11, or even in his examination in chief.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Third, contrary to the Defence’s claim, Ms Herlina had clearly explained that the SATS APS employees were not allowed to receive gifts in relation to their work, whether the giver was a friend or whether the gift was given outside of the staff’s working hours.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Next, pointing out further inaccuracies and deficiencies in the Defence’s submissions, the DPP highlighted that it was not put to Ms Herlina that the accused was scapegoated by SATS APS. Nor was it put to SSI Ng that she had moved between two rooms when recording the accused’s statement P1.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Finally, as regards the accused’s argument that the Prosecution could easily have produced Ahmad as a witness, and that the accused was prejudiced because he was not given an opportunity to cross-examine Ahmad, the Prosecution argued that this claim was misconceived because:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Prosecution was not relying on Ahmad to prove its case as there was already sufficient evidence adduced of the offence, and the Defence could, if it wished, call on Ahmad to testify.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     Further, the Prosecution had already stated at the start of the proceedings that Ahmad was not identified, and that only his name was known. Even then, it was unclear if “Ahmad” was his true name.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     Moreover, the accused had not questioned SSI Ng, the current investigation officer, nor had they called Mr Yong Cheng Liang (the former investigation officer who was offered to the Defence for cross-examination) about Ahmad. Hence, the Defence’s claim that “it would have been easy for the Prosecution to produce Ahmad as a witness”, was not put to either of them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Thus, the Prosecution reiterated that “the Prosecution’s evidence against the accused remains unrebutted, and shows clearly that he corruptly received the cigarettes from Ahmad.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Court’s Analysis and Findings</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I begin my analysis by setting out the law, the elements of the charge that have to be established, and the pertinent issues for this case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law, elements of the charge and issues to be decided</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”) reads:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    If -(<em>a</em>) any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal's affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal's affairs or business;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    ...</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In <em>PP v Leng Kah Poh</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGCA 0051.xml')">[2014] SGCA 51</a> <em>(“Leng Kah Poh</em>”), the Court of Appeal (CA) at [20] accepted the proposition in <em>Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 2 SLR(R) 0211.xml')">[1998] 2 SLR(R) 211</a> that for a section 6(a) PCA offence, the following elements have to be proven:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_a"></a>(a)     Acceptance of gratification;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_b"></a>(b)     As an inducement or reward (for the conferment of a benefit);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was an objective corrupt element in the transaction; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_d"></a>(d)     The recipient accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The CA in <em>Leng Kah Poh</em> explained that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first element is the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence. The other three elements pertain to the <em>mens rea</em> of the recipient ([20] of <em>Leng Kah Poh</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second element of corruption under s 6(a) PCA, is normally part of the same factual enquiry as the third element, and the issue of whether a transaction has a corrupt element is an objective inquiry that is essentially based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man, and this question is to be answered only after the court has found or inferred what the accused intended when he entered into the transaction ([21] and [22] of <em>Leng Kah Poh</em>).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_c"></a>(c)     As regards the fourth element of “guilty knowledge”, the CA at [21] cited the holding of Yong CJ in <em>Chan Wing Seng v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 1 SLR(R) 0721.xml')">[1997] 1 SLR(R) 721</a> at [23] that guilty knowledge refers to whether the accused knew or realised that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard, and this is a subjective test.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     At [43], the CA in <em>Leng Kah Poh</em> further emphasised that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    Establishing the gratification as an inducement or reward is only part of the factual enquiry. It must be linked as the cause or consequence of the conferment of the benefit upon the third party as an analysis under the rubric of an objective corrupt element (see above at [25]). Thus, the correct approach is to ask the question: was there a gratification <em>by</em> inducement or reward to the agent <em>that</em> led to a dishonest or improper gain or advantage being conferred by the agent on the third party?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In the present case, in relation to the elements of the charge against the accused, it was clear from the evidence adduced by both the Prosecution and Defence, and from their submissions, that the following facts were not disputed:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a>(a)     The accused was a customer service associate in the employ of SATS APS between April and May 2018;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a>(b)     The accused’s job requirement was to report the correct weight when he checked in the passenger’s baggage; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_c"></a>(c)     During the material period of the offence, on not less than 3 occasions, the accused had accepted at least 6 packets of ‘Winston’ cigarettes from Ahmad, with each packet costing between $11 and $12.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Thus, in the context of the present charge, the first element of acceptance of gratification was made out. This meant that the Prosecution was left to make out the remaining three elements, namely: (a) whether the gratification was a reward for the conferment of a benefit; (b) whether there was an objective corrupt element in the transaction; and (c) whether he accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge. In relation to these elements, and based on the charge as framed, the following issues had to be decided:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the acceptance of the cigarettes was a reward, and whether it was corrupt in that the accused had accepted them in return for under-reporting the baggage weight for Ahmad’s passengers, and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the accused had accepted the gratification with the requisite guilty knowledge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant portions of the accused’s statement P1</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I have already explained in an earlier part of this judgment why I found the accused’s statement P1 to have been accurately recorded from him, and why I admitted P1 into evidence. I now set out the parts of P1 that I considered especially relevant in determining whether the charge has been made out.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_a"></a>(a)     At paragraph 21 and 22, the accused had stated that the passengers that Ahmad accompanied to accused’s check in counter, “…would usually want to check in 2 to 3 luggages which are always 4 to 5 kg overweight”.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_b"></a>(b)     At paragraph 24, the accused had stated that about one month after he first met Ahmad, they had met him at the smoking area in Terminal 2 at level 1 at the public bus bay. There, Ahmad had asked the accused whether he would like some cigarettes, and the accused had said yes. <em>Ahmad had then gone to purchase cigarettes for the accused</em>, and he came back to pass the packet of cigarettes to the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_c"></a>(c)     At the first line of paragraph 25, the accused had stated that it was from that point on, after their encounter at the smoking area, that he “…started receiving a packet of cigarettes from [Ahmad] for helping him.” The accused further explained that he accepted Ahmad’s offer as he was previously helping Ahmad for free and now, he would be getting cigarettes, which he considered expensive, for his help.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_d"></a>(d)     At paragraph 26, the accused had admitted that Ahmad would usually pass him a packet of cigarettes every 2 to 3 days during his smoke break.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_e"></a>(e)     At paragraph 28, the accused had admitted that if he saw Ahmad, he would help him with 3 passengers on average per afternoon shift, and that he had helped Ahmad at least 67 to 110 times between early March, when he first met Ahmad, to early May which was the last time that he dealt with Ahmad. This was a period of approximately 9 weeks.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_f"></a>(f)     At paragraph 29, the accused had explained that Ahmad would pass him two packets of cigarettes a week. Therefore, Ahmad had given the accused at least six packets of cigarettes in total from mid-April to early May across 3 weeks.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_g"></a>(g)     At paragraph 30 A1, the accused had admitted that Ahmad had given him cigarettes in return for the accused keying in a baggage weight for Ahmad’s passenger that fell within the baggage allowance.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_h"></a>(h)     At paragraph 30 A2, the accused had reiterated that although Ahmad did not explicitly tell the accused what the cigarettes were for, the only contact the accused had with Ahmad was at the check-in counters, and that Ahmad was always accompanied by passengers with excess baggage. Therefore, the accused understood that Ahmad had given him the cigarettes as a token of appreciation for his help with keying in a weight that was within the passengers’ baggage allowance even though their baggage was overweight.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Acceptance of cigarettes as reward and its corrupt nature </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As noted above, from the evidence adduced at the trial, including the contents of the accused’s statement P1, and as could be seen from the submissions of the Defence, it was not disputed that the accused had accepted at least 6 packets of cigarettes from Ahmad during April to May 2018. It was also not disputed that the accused’s job as a SATS APS staff at the check-in counter was to key in the correct weight of the baggage that the passengers wished to check in, and to charge passengers for any excess baggage weight beyond the stated limit. The accused admitted as much in his evidence in court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Yet, as noted from his statement P1 at paragraphs 25 and 30, the accused had admitted that the cigarettes were given by Ahmad to him in return for the accused keying in a lower weight for the baggage of passengers that Ahmad was accompanying such that the lower (inaccurate) weight was keyed in. This lower and inaccurate weight was within the baggage allowance of the passengers, and thus they did not have to pay excess baggage charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     This under-keying of the weight occurred when the passengers were accompanied by Ahmad, on various occasions, to the check-in counter manned by the accused. The accused had carried out this action of under-keying the weight even though the actual weight of the baggage was in excess of the baggage allowance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Further, as admitted by the accused in his statement P1 at paragraph 22, the passengers brought by Ahmad “…would usually want to check in 2 to 3 luggages which are always 4 to 5 kg overweight”. Thus, as the accused was aware that the excess baggage rates to be charged to the passengers ranged from $20-$40 per kg, the accused’s actions would have resulted in significant loss of revenue for the airline. Thus, what the accused did was clearly corrupt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Moreover, I would add that the proximity of time between his helping of Ahmad’s passengers from early March to early May 2018 (see paragraph 28 of his statement P1), and the giving of the packets of cigarettes on at least 3 occasions in April and May 2018 was, in itself “…highly suspicious and suggested that the events were inextricably linked” (see <em>PP v Tang Eng Peng Alan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1995] 2 SLR(R) 0672.xml')">[1995] 2 SLR(R) 672</a> <em>(“Alan Tang”)</em> at [16]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In addition, as the cigarettes were given by Ahmad after the accused had keyed in the lower baggage weight, and they were given by Ahmad to the accused as a “token of appreciation” (see P1 at paragraph 30 A2) the cigarettes would have constituted a reward from Ahmad for what the accused did.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The accused did try, in court, to justify his actions by claiming that while he did check-in Ahmad’s passengers with overweight baggage without requiring them to pay excess baggage fees, this was because they came in as part of a group booking, and he could offset the excess baggage from one passenger with the allowance from another passenger. However, I agreed with the Prosecution that this claim was an obvious afterthought, and I rejected it.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, no mention was made by the accused in his statement P1 that he had adopted such a practice of “setting off” the weight of a passenger’s baggage, or of aggregating the weigh, on the basis of a group booking. This even though the accused had given a detailed account of his dealings with check-in passengers in general (paragraph 12-15), and of his actions and interactions with Ahmad’s passengers in particular (paragraphs 17- 23, 28-30). Instead, the accused’s position in P1 was simply that for Ahmad’s passengers, he (the accused) would key in a weight lower than the actual baggage weight so as to bring it within the baggage allowance (paragraph 20 of P1). Indeed, not only did the accused not mention anything about any “group booking reference”, the accused’s account at paragraph 30 A2 of P1 was that he understood Ahmad to have given him the cigarettes “…as a token of appreciation for [the accused’s] help with keying in a weight that is within the passenger's baggage allowance when their baggages were overweight.”</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, even in his cautioned statement (P10) and his Case for the Defence (P11), no mention was made by the accused of this important evidence i.e. that he had taken the group booking situation into account when keying in the passenger’s baggage weight. Nor had he mentioned that this alleged practice was lawful, regular, or allowed by the company. This even though such claims would have amounted to a defence and/or a justification that what he did was not improper, and that he had hence not under-reported the weight of the baggage as such.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     These crucial omissions – in not one but two such important documents specifically provided in law for him to state his defence – was particularly telling since:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_92-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       In the case of the cautioned statement, there was an explicit statutory warning given to the accused, prior to him providing his statement, that he should state his defence. The text of the statutory warning was particularly telling and is reproduced below.

That this claim only materialised at the trial itself, clearly suggested that the court should draw the inference that it was raised by the accused himself only at the trial as an afterthought, since it amounts to the accused putting “…forward a case at the trial which differs from or is otherwise inconsistent with the …. Case for the Defence”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_d"></a>(d)     I thus rejected the belated and unsubstantiated claim by the accused that that he had taken into the account the group booking situation when entering the weight of the baggage into the system.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In summary, I was satisfied that the accused had accepted the cigarettes from Ahmad as a reward for under-reporting the weight of passenger baggage in the check-in system by his keying in the lower baggage weight for Ahmad’s passengers, and that there was a corrupt element in the transaction.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused had the requisite guilty knowledge </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It was not disputed that SATS APS had prohibited its employees from receiving any gift, in cash or kind, in relation to his employment. Further, the company had made it clear that where a gift was offered, the employee is to decline the gift. If this was not possible, he has to declare it to his employer. These rules, were communicated to the accused through his employment documents (see P2), and through training courses that he attended, namely the induction programme conducted on 19 October 2017, which explained the COC (see P5), and the course titled “Getting Yourself Operationally Ready” conducted on 3 November 2017, which explained its House Rules (see P7).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In the present case, in relation to the cigarettes from Ahmad offered to the accused, he had neither declined them, nor declared them to his employer. Instead, the accused had accepted the cigarettes even though he was aware of the rule against accepting such gifts. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> In this regard, as noted at [54] above, the accused knew that it was wrong for him as a customer service associate to accept gifts from members of public in exchange for doing something that only SATS APS employees could do, and that he was supposed to report to his employers if someone tried to give him gifts, and also to decline the gifts. As could be seen from the evidence, the accused did neither when Ahmad offered him the cigarettes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> This despite the fact that offers of cigarettes to the accused were made to him on at least 3 occasions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     While counsel also tried to argue that the cigarettes were of “token value”, and the accused himself similarly tried to downplay the significance of what he had accepted from Ahmad by saying that “…a cigarette is just a cigarette”, I note that the gratification was not as insignificant as what the Defence tried to portray. Instead, for the accused who was earning only about $700 a month at that time (see paragraph 5 of P1), the accused himself had admitted that the cigarettes that he received from Ahmad “are expensive” (see paragraph 7 of P1), a position that he also maintained in court. Indeed, the cigarettes were clearly a significant enough reward for him to want to keep them, instead of rejecting them or informing his employers about them, actions which he knew he should otherwise have taken.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In short, it was clear from the evidence produced by the Prosecution, as well as the accused’s own evidence, showed that the accused acted with a guilty mind in accepting the cigarettes from Ahmad as a “token of appreciation” for under-reporting the weight of the baggage for Ahmad’s passengers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     While the Defence also highlighted that the rule of SATS APS against receipt of gifts by its employees did not apply to “gifts exchanged between relatives and personal friends”, and counsel further tried to argue that Ahmad was a personal friend of the accused and that Ahmad had given the cigarettes to the accused in that capacity, I agreed with the Prosecution that the overwhelming evidence clearly reflected something completely different. In other words, Ahmad was no “personal friend” of the accused. Neither were the cigarettes given to the accused because of any such alleged friendship between them. In coming to these conclusions, I took into account the following facts:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_a"></a>(a)     Aside from knowing him simply as “Ahmad”, the accused knew little about Ahmad, the giver of the cigarettes. For example, he did not know Ahmad’s full name, or his nationality (other than guessing that he could be Indian or Bangladesh because of the latter’s skin colour). Neither did he meet Ahmad anywhere other than at the airport, where it would be the latter who approached him either at the check-in counter or at the smoking area. Further, aside from these superficial interactions and meetings, the accused admitted that he and Ahmad had no other interaction. They also did not exchange phone numbers, nor did the accused ask about Ahmad’s personal life. In addition, while the accused accepted the cigarettes from Ahmad, he did not reciprocate with any money or gift for Ahmad. Instead, what the accused did was to (improperly) under-declare the baggage weight of Ahmad’s passengers.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_b"></a>(b)     As further evidence of their relatively distant relationship, and the accused’s surprising lack of curiosity or interest about Ahmad, the accused did not even ask Ahmad about his role <em>vis a vis</em> Ahmad’s passengers, nor did he query about clearly curious aspects of Ahmad’s behavior. For one, while he would see Ahmad about 1 to 3 times a day at the check-in counter sending off the passengers, the accused said that he never asked Ahmad why he was always there sending off so many “friends”, as he felt that this was none of his business. In addition, while Ahmad would ask for one or two sticks of cigarettes back from the accused whenever Ahmad gave the accused a packet of cigarettes, the accused never queried Ahmad as to why the latter wanted the one or two sticks back, nor did he know what Ahmad did with those sticks since he had never seen Ahmad smoke in front of him.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_c"></a>(c)     Indeed, while the accused and Ahmad would meet at the smoking corner where the cigarettes were passed, the accused did not even know if Ahmad was a smoker, although he assumed this to be the case since Ahmad had asked for the one or two sticks of cigarettes back.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_d"></a>(d)     Thus, rather than being friends, let alone “personal friends”, the evidence suggested the contrary to be the case. In this regard, the accused admitted at paragraph 20 of P1 that he had tried to avoid Ahmad who was “always looking” for him to seek his help, and the accused even went so far as to admit that Ahmad was “irritating [the accused].”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Further, I would add that even if the accused and Ahmad could be considered “friends”, and even if one was willing to accept that they could even be regarded as “personal friends”, it was clear that the cigarettes were not given by Ahmad to the accused out of any alleged friendship. Instead, as the accused himself admitted in P1 (at paragraph 30 A1), the reason why Ahmad gave him the cigarettes was because he had keyed in a weight within Ahmad’s passengers’ baggage allowance even though their bags were overweight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In summary, for the reasons set out above, I was satisfied that accused clearly had the requisite guilty knowledge for the commission of the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The absence of Ahmad from the trial</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The Defence tried to make an issue over the failure of the Prosecution to call Ahmad as a witness. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that the argument by the Defence on this issue was misconceived, since the full identity or nationality of Ahmad was not known, even to the accused who was supposedly his “friend”. Further, there was nothing to suggest that the Prosecution independently knew who Ahmad was, or that the enforcement authorities had previously contacted Ahmad, or that they could now contact him but had failed to do so, either deliberately or otherwise.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    There was also nothing to suggest that there had been a breach of any disclosure or other legal obligations <em>vis a vis</em> the Prosecution’s inability or failure to identify Ahmad, or to offer Ahmad as a witness, or to call Ahmad to testify, or as regards any other aspects of evidence connected with Ahmad. Indeed, since the Prosecution’s case was largely dependent on the accused’s own confessions in P1, and since the evidence adduced was sufficient to prove all the elements of the charge, there was plainly no need for the Prosecution to rely on Ahmad’s evidence to prove the case against the accused. In other words, there was clearly no reason for the Prosecution to have to produce, or to call Ahmad as a witness, in order to discharge its legal or evidential burden.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    At the same time, if the Defence felt that Ahmad was important to its case, it should, and presumably could, have called him to testify, especially as Ahmad was supposedly the accused’s friend. Alternatively, having known from an early stage that the Prosecution would not, and could not, call or contact Ahmad, I also noted that the Defence could have, but declined to question the investigators about what they knew or had ascertained about Ahmad’s identity, whereabouts or evidence, or to suggest that they had access to Ahmad and/or that there was some ulterior motive in not calling Ahmad to testify (see <em>Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad</em> v <em>PP</em> [2020] SCGA 25 at [68] – [74]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In short, I was of the view that the Defence’s argument about the alleged negative implication of Ahmad’s absence in court, and how this supposedly weakened the case against the accused, was completely misguided.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Making a baseless allegation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    For completeness, in his submissions made at the close of trial, counsel suggested that SATS APS had perverted the course of justice by making false claims against the accused. Specifically, at [20] of his written submissions, it was stated that because of the newspaper reports about touting at the airport:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    It is obvious that because of the newspaper reports SATS was desperate to clear its name and want (<em>sic</em>) to show to the public that action has been taken. To this end they concluded that the Accused was taking gifts from Ahmad for favours and dismissed the Accused on 26 July 2018. Then in late 2018 the Accused (<em>sic</em>) case was reported by SATS to CPIB and all the documents were handed over to CPIB for their investigation. The Accused was made a “scapegoat” by SATS to clear their name. It is submitted that the Accused was been unfairly targeted by SATS for the purpose of clearing SATS (<em>sic</em>) name (<em>sic</em>) They threw the Accused under the bus in order to save their name.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In the Prosecution’s reply, DPP Grace Lim pointed out that this serious allegation were not put to Ms Herlina, nor was any evidence put forward by the Defence to substantiate the claim made by counsel. Further, she argued that the allegation was essentially that SATS was trying to frame the accused, which if true, would be a criminal offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In my view, there was no evidence whatsoever produced by the Defence to support its bare allegation about the alleged “scapegoating” of the accused by SATS APS. I would further add that without any form of substantiation, or any factual foundation, and especially without even putting this serious allegation to any of the witnesses, it was inappropriate and disingenuous for the Defence to mount such an argument (see also <em>Mia Mulkes v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20900-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGHC 252</a> at [4] – [6]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence clearly establishes the guilt of the accused </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In summary, after a careful consideration of the evidence and the submissions, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had established the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted him accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Phase</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The accused is a first offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In respect of a charge under s under Section 6(a) of the PCA, the prescribed punishment is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. It is also provided under section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68 that where the charge is framed under section 124(4), the court may sentence that person to “…2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable if that person had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence mentioned in that subsection”.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submissions on sentence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The Prosecution submitted for a sentence in the region of at least 3 weeks’ imprisonment and a penalty of $66. The basis of the Prosecution’s submission was as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_a"></a>(a)     This case fell within the category 2 of private sector corruption cases identified by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the seminal case of <em>PP v Syed Mostofa Romel</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17608-SSP.xml')">[2015] 3 SLR 1166</a> (<em>“Mostofa Romel”</em>), since there was a breach of duty by the accused to his principal by his forbearing to do what he was duty-bound to do, <em>i.e.</em> to input the actual baggage weight, in return for the gratification.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was danger caused to the flights which Ahmad’s passengers had boarded, due to the inaccurate weight of their baggage. Losses were also caused to the airline due to excess baggage fees that were not collected as a result of the accused’s under-reporting of the true baggage weight for these passengers.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_c"></a>(c)     Damage was also caused to Singapore’s reputation because Ahmad’s passengers, many of whom are foreigners, managed to travel with overweight baggage without the need to pay for excess baggage fees as a result of the accused’s actions. They may thus come to think that corruption is business as usual in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The Prosecution also cited the sentences imposed in similar cases involving offenders who were customer service associates from companies such as SATS APS and UBTS Pte Ltd, which operated at Changi Airport. Those offenders had similarly accepted brides for under-reporting the baggage weight of departing passengers. The offenders identified were:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_a"></a>(a)     Gerizim Kirubai Raj Daved (“Gerizim”) in DAC-910806-2019;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_b"></a>(b)     Ayyadurai Karunanithi (“Ayyadurai”) in DAC-910807-2019; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_c"></a>(c)     Patel Hiteshkumar Chandubhai (“Patel”) in DAC-910808-2019.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The bribes accepted by the above offenders ranged from $500 to $800. The offenders had all pleaded guilty (PG) and were sentenced to imprisonment terms that ranged from 7 to 9 weeks. Penalties equivalent to the gratification accepted were also imposed on them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Based on a comparison with the facts and sentencing factors of those cases, with the present case, the Prosecution argued that imprisonment of at least 3 weeks, and a penalty of $66 should be imposed in the present case. I will discuss the cases highlighted by the Prosecution in greater detail at a later part of this judgement when explaining how I arrived at the final sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation Plea </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The counsel, Mr Kumar, gave a short oral mitigation plea.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Essentially, he highlighted that the accused is now 25 years old, and that he works as a driver, earns $1,600 per month and that he contributes to household expenses. The accused started working after his national service and his studies. Counsel also emphasised that the accused has a clean record, and argued that the Prosecution’s proposed sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment was “on the high side”, although counsel did not explain why this was so. Finally, counsel asked the court to impose a “minimum sentence” on the accused, and proposed an imprisonment sentence of between 1 week to 10 days.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    As this case involves private sector corruption, the first step in the analysis of sentence would be to determine which of the three broad and non-exhaustive categories identified by Sundaresh Menon CJ at [26] of <em>Mostofa Romel</em> that this case falls into.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In this regard, it appears quite clear that this is a category 2 case i.e. one “… where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This also is typically done at the payer’s behest.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Specifically, the facts showed that the accused had under-reported the weight of Ahmad’s passengers’ baggage in the check-in computer system, when his duty was to enter the correct weight. By doing this, the accused had failed to perform his duty, and had conveyed a benefit in that Ahmad’s passengers would then not have had to pay the fees for the extra baggage, which they would otherwise have had to do, if the accused had discharged his duty to key in the correct baggage weight as he ought to have done.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Further, as noted in the <em>Practitioners’ Library: Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em> vol 2 (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“<em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em>”) at p 1375, which was referred to by Sundaresh Menon CJ at [23] of <em>Mostofa Romel</em>, where private sector corruption involves a compromise of one’s duty or a serious betrayal of trust, the starting point is likely to be a custodial sentence. Further, at [28] of <em>Mostofa Romel</em>, his Honour observed that category 2 cases “…frequently attract custodial sentences”. I would add that custodial sentences were indeed imposed on each of the three offenders referred to by the Prosecution (see [112] above), which were essentially all category 2 cases. In those cases, each of the offenders had, in circumstances similar to that of the accused, been convicted of accepting bribes to “forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Thus, in line with the above sentencing guidance, and the cases cited by the Prosecution, I agreed that a custodial sentence was inevitable in the present case. This same conclusion was also rightly reached by counsel, who submitted for an imprisonment sentence ranging from a week to 10 days, while the Prosecution argued that the imprisonment term should be at least 3 weeks long.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    As for the length of the custodial sentence to impose, I took note of the aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_122-p2_a"></a>(a)     As regards the issue of harm caused, I agreed that the accused’s actions had likely caused significant loss in revenue to the airline concerned. This is because the accused had admitted to having “…helped Ahmad at least 67 to 110 times in total from early March to early May which is for a period of approximately 9 weeks”. He had also admitted that Ahmad’s passengers “…would usually want to check in 2 to 3 luggages which are always 4 to 5 kg overweight.” <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> While the exact loss to the airline could not be ascertained with certainly, I noted Ms Herlina’s testimony that the baggage rates was $60 for a 20 kg baggage allowance, and $20 per kg for excess baggage. Thus, in light of what was admitted by the accused, the losses caused to the airline could have been in the thousands of dollars.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_122-p2_b"></a>(b)     Next, I also agreed that damage would have been caused to Singapore’s reputation especially since for Ahmad’s passengers who were travelling out of Singapore with overweight baggage for which they had not paid the excess baggage charges, their last impression could well be that Singapore is a country where corruption is an accepted practice at least among its airport staff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    However, as for the Prosecution’s argument about danger to the flights which Ahmad’s passengers had boarded, due to the inaccurate (and excessive) weight of their baggage, I was of the view that there was no direct evidence that any actual harm had resulted. Thus, while I accepted that there was potential for harm to such flights, I was willing to give the accused the benefit of the doubt, and did not consider the possible harm as an additional aggravating factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Moving on to the sentences imposed in the cases cited by the Prosecution, my first observation is that while the cases cited were all unreported decisions, I could not ignore the many similarities in the circumstances of those cases, with the facts in the present case. Further, in view of these similarities, the sentencing considerations that applied in the present case, would also likely have factored in the sentencing decision in those cases, making the sentences imposed in those cases especially relevant as guides here.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    In line with my views above, and to better appreciate the similarities as well as the differences between the cited cases and the present case, I have set out below a table adapted from the sentencing table put up by the Prosecution.</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="15%"/> <col width="23.34%"/> <col width="18.34%"/> <col width="23.32%"/> <col width="20%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offender</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Haris </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(accused)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Gerizim</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ayyadurai</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Patel</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Bribe value</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least $66</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$630</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$500</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$800</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">No. of occasions of bribes</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 3</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 11</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 12</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 10</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Period of offending</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Apr-May 2018 </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(1 month) </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Jan -Jul 2018 </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(7 months)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Apr-May 2018</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> (1 ½ months)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Jan-Oct 2016 (10 months)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Claimed trial/ PG</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 days of trial</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Pleaded guilty on (2<sup>nd</sup> mention) about two weeks after being first charged</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Facts of offence</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Case involved 3 departing passengers a day, and happened 3 times a week.

Unsurprisingly, the offenders there were all sentenced to higher sentences than that sought by the Prosecution in the present case. Specifically, the amounts of gratification involved ranged from $500 (resulting in 9 weeks’ imprisonment for Ayyadurai), $630 (resulting in 7 weeks’ imprisonment for Gerizim), and $800 (resulting in 8 weeks’ imprisonment for Patel). I further noted that the offenders in those cases had all pleaded guilty relatively early, while the accused here had claimed trial, and also made unsubstantiated allegations that SATS had scapegoated him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I would add that from the facts set out, the offences committed by Gerizim and Ayyadurai were also in 2018, and the period of their offences overlapped with that of the accused. This suggested that there was a certain prevalence of such offences being committed by customer service associates at Changi Airport at around the same time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    As for the mitigating factors, I noted that the accused (like the other offenders in the cases cited by the Prosecution) was a first offender. Further, his offences were committed in April and May 2018, and that he was 22 years old at that time (his date of birth was 20 January 2016). As for the other matters cited by the Defence, I did not find them to be of any mitigating value.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Thus, having considered all the relevant sentencing factors, the value of gratification, and the sentences imposed in the cited cases, I was of the view that an appropriate custodial sentence was 2 weeks’ imprisonment. While this sentence was lower than the minimum sentence sought by the Prosecution, I nonetheless considered it to be of sufficient length to reflect the aggravating and mitigating factors of the case, and to be in line with the cases cited.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Further, pursuant to section 13(1) of the PCA, I also imposed a penalty of $66 (in default one day imprisonment) on the accused. This penalty amount was decided based on the fact that the gratification identified was of at least 6 packets of cigarettes, and the value of each packet of cigarette was assessed to be around $11 to $12 (as per paragraph 24 of the accused’s statement P1). I therefore took the lower estimated value of each packet of cigarette (i.e. $11) and multiplied this by the minimum number of packets of cigarettes that the accused was alleged to have accepted as gratification to derive the penalty sum.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The accused being dissatisfied has filed an appeal against his conviction, sentence and penalty imposed. He is on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>NE, 9 November 2020, 13/6-9</p>
