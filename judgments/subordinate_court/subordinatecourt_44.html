He employed Sunita Priya d/o Perumal (“Priya”) as his office manager. She was also apparently his girlfriend.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Subramaniam was employed by Evershine as a cleaning supervisor. Buvan was an IT vendor who supplied computer software to Evershine. Koh was a Grab driver and assisted Evershine in its transport requirements.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Khevin, a Malaysian citizen, was the victim named in the charges. He was interviewed for a job with Evershine around 16 March 2017. His previous employment with SATs had been terminated. He was being investigated by the police for a case of molest at his former workplace, but no charges were eventually brought. Khevin was issued with a special pass for immigration purposes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Evershine deployed Khevin to work at various locations as a cleaner. Subramaniam trained him and told him where to work. They became quite close and Khevin even confided in Subramaniam about the molest case and his financial woes. To show his work product, Khevin sent photographs of the work he did to Priya via WhatsApp. Throughout this time, Khevin did not have a valid work permit. His employment with Evershine was eventually terminated on 5 April 2017.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On that day, the four accused persons were at the office in the late afternoon. They testified that Buvan was there to discuss some IT issues and that Koh went there to collect payment for services rendered. Subramaniam was also there since he worked for Evershine. They went to the Kopitiam at the ground floor of 11 Woodlands Close, where they had beer and food. Sivakumar s/o Eelankovan (DW5) (“Sivakumar”) who did deliveries for Kumar joined them, but he did not drink alcohol.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Priya had arranged to meet Khevin that evening and he arrived on his motorcycle at about 8.30 p.m.. He saw the accused persons drinking at the Kopitiam. He approached Kumar who told him to go to the office. Khevin then proceeded to level 6 and parked his motorcycle outside the office. He left his helmet on top of the motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The four accused persons and Sivakumar also proceeded to level 6.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The layout of level 6 is shown in the sketch plan, Exhibit P8. Vehicles could drive up to that level. The vehicles could then drive through level 6 via a driveway, which separated parking lots and units on both sides. Parking lots were situated on both sides of the driveway and the units were situated immediately after the parking lots.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For reasons which were disputed, trouble broke out at level 6, first outside the office. It was alleged that Kumar threatened Khevin on the terms stated in Kumar’s amended second charge and punched Khevin in the face. CCTV footage then captured Koh pushing Khevin across the driveway i.e. from Evershine’s side towards what was known as “the lorry area” on the other side. The lorry area was near unit #06-36. What happened there was not captured by CCTV. However, video evidence showed that the other accused persons and Sivakumar followed Koh and Khevin to the lorry area. The prosecution alleged that Khevin was further assaulted there by the four accused persons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Originally, two lion statues had been placed outside unit #06-36. One of them was thrown onto the ground, causing it to break into smaller pieces. Parts of the statue pulverized, causing the floor to be covered with white powder. After the incident, Subramaniam, Koh and Priya swept and washed the area outside unit #06-36. They disposed of the debris.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     CCTV footage showed that Khevin was in the lorry area for about four minutes. He then ran or moved away quickly. He stopped after a distance, carried on moving and finally sat on a chair outside another unit. Subramaniam approached and spoke to him. The other accused persons followed. Kumar also spoke to him and put his arm around Khevin’s shoulder.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     While they were walking towards the office, Khevin broke free and ran away. He got to the loading bay at level 1 where there was a guard post. There, he met security guard Lindagounder Palani (PW3), who noticed scratches on Khevin’s face and that he was in a state of panic. Lindagounder reported the matter to his company, while Khevin called the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As documented in the first information report (Exhibit P6), Khevin called the police at about 9.45 p.m.. The first police officers who arrived were W/SSS Shalini d/o Subramani (PW2) (“W/SSS Shalini”) and SSgt Muhammad Adnan bin Mohamed (PW6) (“SSgt Adnan”). Both officers observed that Khevin was bleeding from his forehead, lips and the right side of the back of his head. They called for an ambulance. They interviewed Khevin and brought him to level 6. The officers observed that the floor outside unit #06-36 was wet. They found a “broken piece of ornament” (Exhibit P10), which was probably a piece of the lion statue. W/SSS Shalini also took six photographs of the scene (Exhibit P9).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Khevin was eventually conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”) in an ambulance. He was admitted at 11.42 p.m. on 5 April 2017 and discharged at 6.30 a.m. the next day. He was given five days’ medical leave.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Except for Subramaniam, the accused persons left the scene before the police arrived. They drove off in their cars.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The next day (6 April 2017), Khevin met the investigating officer Inspector James Raj s/o Nelamogan (PW12) at Jurong Police Division HQ. The four accused persons and Priya went to the police station between 2.00 p.m. to 3.00 p.m., where Kumar was arrested. Priya made a police report against Khevin (Exhibit P34). She alleged that Khevin molested her after she terminated his employment as he failed to produce documents showing his immigration status.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Khevin’s evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Khevin testified that when he arrived at level 6, the four accused persons were already there. Kumar and Subramaniam brought him to the upper level of the office where Priya was. Kumar asked why he spoke disrespectfully to Priya earlier that day. When Priya decided to terminate his employment, he asked about the five to six days’ salary owing to him. Kumar replied in a haughty manner that his salary would come looking for him. By this, Khevin understood that he would not be paid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Thereafter, Kumar and Subramaniam brought him downstairs. They joined the co-accused persons and Sivakumar at the table and drank alcohol. When he lit a cigarette, Kumar told him not to smoke in front of him. Khevin replied, “… it was my money I will smoke” and asked, “Who are you to ask.” The four accused persons and Sivakumar then surrounded him and stood close to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Kumar threatened him on the terms stated in Kumar's amended second charge. Khevin felt frightened by the threat and started to perspire.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Kumar then held on to Khevin’s neck with his left hand and punched Khevin’s face with his right hand. Upon seeing this, Koh took a chair and threw it. He grabbed Khevin’s shirt around the neck and pushed him to the lorry area, where he punched Khevin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Khevin testified that at the lorry area, Kumar held on to his neck very tightly and pulled the string off his jacket. Kumar, who was wearing two rings in each hand, also punched him on his forehead, cheeks and mouth using both hands.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Khevin started to bleed and punched Kumar twice in return. Kumar went backwards and placed his hands over his face.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At this stage, Subramaniam pushed him to the ground. Buvan then took the stone lion statue and threw it onto the ground where it broke into pieces. Buvan then took a piece of the statue and threw it at Khevin. It hit Khevin at the back of his head, near his right ear. Khevin fell to the ground and was covered with white powdery substance from the statue.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Khevin tried to run away, but Subramaniam pulled the backpack which Khevin was wearing. The strap of the backpack broke and it fell to the ground.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Subramaniam then punched him on his cheeks and mouth. He bled from his upper lip and the left side of his face was swollen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Khevin testified that when he was lying on the ground, Koh used a broom stick to hit him twice. Kumar came and tried to kick his face. Khevin covered his face and turned towards his right to prevent Kumar from kicking him. Kumar then held on to Khevin’s shirt and got him to stand up. Khevin managed to break free. He ran away, leaving his bag behind.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case for the defence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Kumar (DW1)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Kumar gave evidence that Priya arranged to meet Khevin to discuss some administrative matters and Khevin’s complaints. When Khevin arrived at the Kopitiam, Kumar told him to go to level 6 to see Priya. The accused persons still had two to three bottles of beer left and brought their drinks up to the office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Kumar testified that while they were drinking at a table which was placed just outside his office, he heard Priya shout. He rushed upstairs with Subramaniam and found Priya crying. She claimed that Khevin molested her. Khevin then left the office but Subramaniam followed him. Kumar went down a short time later and started to question Khevin. However, Khevin became very aggressive and tried to move away. When Kumar told Khevin not to run, Khevin punched him on his left cheek. Kumar tried to grab hold of Khevin as Khevin was trying to hit him. He punched Khevin once or twice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     At this stage, Koh intervened and pushed Khevin, who was very aggressive and trying to retaliate. Koh pushed Khevin to the lorry area. All of them followed to protect Koh from any harm. They tried to tell Khevin to calm down. At the lorry area, Khevin admitted that what he did was wrong. When Kumar said that he intended to call the police, Khevin swung his hands at all of them to punch them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Subramaniam then went in to defend him by punching Khevin. All of them tried their best to catch Khevin so that they could hand him over to the police.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Kumar also testified that Khevin picked up the lion statue and wanted to throw it at them. However, Subramaniam took it away and threw it onto the floor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Khevin managed to run away but then sat down outside another unit. The accused persons decided to ask him to settle the matter. Subramaniam was the first to approach Khevin who admitted what he did was wrong. Kumar spoke to Khevin who said that he was very sorry. He asked Kumar not to call the police. When they got to the office, Khevin ran away when Priya said that she would call the police. As he ran, he shouted some words in Tamil.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Kumar also testified that as he was under police supervision, he contacted his supervision officer who told him to report to the station with Priya the next day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Subramaniam (DW2)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Subramaniam testified that after Khevin rode up to level 6, the accused persons followed about 15 minutes later. As he was making his way to the upper level of the office, Subramaniam heard Priya shout. He saw her crying, but she refused to tell him anything. He then went downstairs to report the matter to Kumar who went up to find out what had happened. On Kumar’s instructions, Subramaniam brought Khevin to the first level of the office. When Kumar returned, he asked Khevin “Why you did such a thing?” Khevin then started to talk disrespectfully to Kumar.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Koh spoke to Khevin but Khevin “started to act a little aggressively to Koh”. Koh pushed Khevin and Khevin pushed Koh back. Koh then pushed Khevin towards the lorry area. The other accused persons followed. Kumar had too much to drink and was not steady on his feet. When Khevin punched Kumar two to three times, Subramaniam intervened. Khevin tried to punch him, but Subramaniam punched him two to three times instead. Khevin also tried to punch Buvan, but Buvan pushed Khevin’s hand away and punched Khevin on his shoulder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In his anger, Khevin lifted the lion statue and wanted to throw it at Koh or Buvan.

When the security guard Devamani Sevashanmugam (“Devamani”) (PW4) came by and asked what was happening, Subramaniam told him it was a company problem.

Subramaniam informed him that Priya shouted when Khevin molested her. After a few minutes, Kumar came down and Buvan “went towards Khevin”. Kumar confronted Khevin about what happened.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Buvan claimed that Khevin became agitated and clenched his fists. Khevin showed a “rude attitude face” and his body language showed that he was trying to escape what he had done. Koh intervened and held Khevin back. As Khevin moved backwards towards the lorry area, Koh “followed in his footsteps.” The other accused persons also followed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     When they confronted Khevin at the lorry area, Khevin tried to snatch Kumar’s gold chain which snapped. In his frustration, Khevin punched Kumar in his cheekbone. In retaliation and self-defence, Kumar punched Khevin. As Kumar was drunk, Subramaniam punched Khevin to defend himself and Kumar. Buvan and Koh tried to “control” Khevin. This resulted in a scuffle, during which they tried to block Khevin’s kicks and punches. Buvan claimed that he was hurt by two punches and kicks to his shin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Buvan testified that “out of frustration, anger that he couldn’t do anything”, Khevin picked up the lion statue intending to throw it at them. However, Subramaniam snatched it from Khevin and threw it onto the ground. Khevin continued being aggressive and violent. While they were “controlling” him, he fell and was covered with white powder from the statue.

Subramaniam walked slowly towards him and spoke to him. When Kumar arrived, he put his right arm around Khevin’s shoulder and asked him to apologize for what he did to Priya. As they were walking back towards the office, Khevin elbowed Kumar and ran away. He shouted vulgarities and said that he would get his Malaysian gang to attack them. At this point, Buvan saw a female security guard.

Both Subramaniam and Kumar went up, while Buvan and he continued to drink. Not long after, Khevin appeared, followed by Kumar. They conversed in Tamil. They were getting louder and sounded agitated. Buvan told him that Khevin had molested Priya. Koh then went over to Khevin, who was gesturing and getting more agitated. Koh pushed him and asked why he was talking to Kumar in that manner. Khevin moved backwards, while still gesturing with his hands. Koh continued to push him to the lorry area but did not know who was following from behind.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     At the lorry area, the accused persons questioned Khevin.

Subramaniam approached and hit Khevin. Khevin then picked up the lion statue. Subramaniam snatched it away and threw it onto the floor, where it broke into pieces and became powder. It was slippery and Khevin fell, causing his head and clothes to be covered in powder. Koh then pulled Khevin up to let him go.

This was more consistent with Khevin’s version of events i.e. that he punched Kumar twice in the face at the lorry area after Kumar punched him. It did not accord with the claim by the defence that Khevin was very aggressive and punched Kumar multiple times. In any event, Kumar’s alleged injury was relatively minor and paled in comparison to the multiple injuries sustained by Khevin.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subramanian did not sustain any injuries</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Subramaniam did not claim that Khevin struck him or that he sustained any injury. This showed that the claim that Khevin struck all the accused persons was an exaggeration, since Subramaniam was not injured. It was also unlikely that Khevin was as violent as the accused persons made him out to be.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Buvan’s injuries (if any) were at the most minor</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Buvan testified that he was hurt when Khevin punched him twice and gave kicks to his shin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> He gave a conflicting account in cross-examination as he stated that Khevin only punched him once on the shoulder and kicked him once in the shin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> In his police statement recorded on 6 April 2017 (Exhibit P28), he failed to state that he was punched and kicked, but only claimed that he used his arms to prevent Khevin’s hits or punches. In his further statement recorded on 2 May 2017 (Exhibit P29), Buvan stated that he defended himself by blocking Khevin’s hits, and that he was hit by one of Khevin’s “throws”. He failed to mention that he was punched twice and kicked in his shin. There were therefore discrepancies in the various accounts which Buvan gave, which cast doubts on whether Khevin caused him any injury.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Buvan claimed when cross-examined by Kumar that he went to his own doctor in April 2017. He informed the doctor that he was injured in his shin and shoulder and was given ointment to apply.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> However, he failed to produce a medical report to show that he visited a doctor or that he was injured. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Buvan wavered in his position. His evidence suggested that he may not even have sought medical treatment since he was not advised to do so:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    You were in pain but there was no blood? And you have no medical report to show any injuries sustained on the 5<sup>th</sup> of April 2017, correct? You are not tendering any medical certificate, correct?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    No, I am not tendering any medical certificate because when I informed the police about this, the police officer did not advise me to go and see a doctor, neither see a --- go to the hospital A &amp; E to check on this. So I didn’t know that that is the procedure.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It was therefore difficult to fathom whether Buvan had sought medical treatment or not. If he did, as he originally claimed, he could have easily obtained a medical report to corroborate his claim that he was injured. Further, his alleged injuries were far less serious than Khevin’s. At most, he was injured on his shoulder and shin, whereas Khevin suffered multiple injuries, most of which were at his head and face.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Koh did not sustain any injuries</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Although Koh claimed that Khevin assaulted all the accused persons, he did not sustain any injury. He stated when cross-examined by Kumar:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    Were you injured during the assault?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    No. I was not.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    So, Mr Khevin did not attack you in any ways. You were not injured in any ways?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    He did --- he did --- he was attacking us but I don’t think he managed to reach me.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     When Koh pushed Khevin to the lorry area, Khevin could have easily retaliated by striking him. They were in close proximity and Khevin could have easily reached Koh. If Khevin was as aggressive and violent as claimed, it would have been natural for him to fight back against Koh. Since Koh did not suffer any injuries, it was clear that Khevin was not spoiling for a fight.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The large disparity in injuries indicated that Khevin was the victim of an assault</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Khevin suffered multiple injuries. There was no doubt that these were at the hands of the accused persons. Most of these injuries were caused to his face and head. The doctor gave him five days’ medical leave. In contrast, Subramaniam and Koh suffered no injuries at all, while Kumar and Buvan’s alleged injuries were minor. The degree and nature of Khevin’s injuries indicated that it was much more likely that he was the victim of an assault rather than the attacker. Conversely, the relative lack of injuries to the accused persons indicated that they were not the victims of an attack by Khevin.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">No evidence to show that Khevin molested Priya</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The defence claimed that Khevin had molested Priya, and that this triggered off a series of events. The accused persons also claimed that they intended to apprehend Khevin and hand him over to the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The accused persons alleged that Khevin molested Priya when he went up to the office. This was a bare claim which was devoid of substance. None of them witnessed the alleged molest. Although Mr Edmond Pereira (who was then acting for the accused persons) put to Khevin in some detail as to how Priya was molested,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> the defence failed to adduce any evidence to support this claim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Priya was not called as a witness, although her evidence would have been crucial to the defence case. Her police report (Exhibit P34) in which she alleged she was molested was not evidence of the truth. The impression given throughout the trial was that Priya would be called as a defence witness. However, no cogent reason was provided for not doing so. In the absence of any evidence, the court was left to conclude that P0riya had not been molested, and that the claim of molest was an attempt to bolster the defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The allegation of molest formed the cornerstone of the case for the defence. Subsequent events (as claimed by the accused persons) were inextricably linked to the alleged molest. The accused persons also justified much of their conduct with reference to this. Since the court concluded that Priya had not been molested, many aspects of the joint defence which were predicated on the issue of molest could not stand up to scrutiny. These included the following:-</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the absence of any evidence to show that Priya had been molested, the claim that Priya screamed and accused Khevin of molesting her was totally implausible.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)     Priya could not have been upset and distraught since she was not molested. For example, Kumar testified that when he went up to the office, Priya was crying and claimed that Khevin molested her. His testimony could not be true, since Priya was not molested. To the contrary, the video evidence showed that after the assault on Khevin, Priya had the presence of mind to calmly and efficiently clean up the scene.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_c"></a>(c)     Since Priya was not molested, it could not be true that the accused persons confronted Khevin about this.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_d"></a>(d)     The claim that Khevin became agitated and violent when they confronted him for molesting Priya cannot be true. This affected the credibility of the defence version of how the events started.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_e"></a>(e)     The claim that the accused persons intended to apprehend Khevin and hand him to the police for molesting Priya was also untrue. In fact, none of the accused persons called the police, nor did they ask the security guards who were at level 6 to assist them to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_f"></a>(f)     The claim that Khevin admitted to the molest, expressed remorse and wanted to apologize to Priya was outlandish.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_g"></a>(g)     The claim that the accused persons led Khevin back to the office intending for him to apologize to Priya was untrue.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_h"></a>(h)     The claim that Khevin ran away when Priya said that she wanted to call the police to report the molest was also untrue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Khevin was not the aggressor</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Khevin testified that when he was outside the office, Kumar confronted him when he lit up a cigarette, threatened him, then held him by his neck and punched his face. His testimony implicated Kumar as the aggressor and the one who started the events. Khevin was outnumbered by the accused persons and it would have been foolish for him to have been the aggressor. The facts show that it was unlikely that he was.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Kumar claimed that Khevin became very aggressive when they confronted him outside the office. When Khevin tried to move away, he told Khevin not to run. Khevin then punched him on the left cheek.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Kumar’s account was supported by Buvan who claimed that Khevin clenched his fists, showed a “rude attitude face” and that his body language showed that he was trying to escape what he had done.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Since both Kumar and Buvan testified that Khevin tried to run away and escape, they must have noticed that he tried to move away from the group. In fact, Kumar reacted to this and told him not to run. By trying to run away and escape, it was improbable that Khevin was displaying aggression, since he would be in retreat. If he had been very aggressive (as the defence claimed), the likelihood was that he would have stood his ground to fight. He would not have tried to run away and there would have been no need for Kumar to tell him not to run.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Since Khevin tried to run away, this showed that he made efforts to disengage. As he was not successful in his attempt to run away, the probability was that the accused persons prevented him from doing so. Koh certainly had a play to part in this.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Koh was very aggressive towards Khevin</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The objective video evidence showed that Koh had aggressively pushed Khevin by his neck towards the lorry area. Khevin did not struggle, put up a fight, or hit Koh as he was being pushed. Koh was thus able to push Khevin backwards for several seconds without challenge. Matters escalated when Kumar and the other accused persons entered the lorry area a few seconds later.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused persons escalated matters by entering the lorry area</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     When the other accused persons followed Koh and Khevin to the lorry area, this was a further display of aggression. They must have, together with Koh, intended to escalate matters. If their intention was to maintain peace or calm the situation down, they could simply have remained at Evershine’s side. They had ample time to call the police. They could also have called the building’s security officers for assistance. Instead, they chose to pursue Khevin into the lorry area where there was an escalation of violence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The claim that they followed Koh to protect him was self-serving and had no merit. Koh drove Khevin backwards and had the upper hand. It was unlikely that Koh was in any danger, since it was Kumar, and not Khevin, who started the attack. Moreover, Khevin was of a bigger build, stronger and much younger than Koh. He was then about 23 years of age, while Koh was about 54 years of age. Khevin could have easily struck Koh or tried to overpower him, instead of yielding to the push. To Khevin’s credit, he did not retaliate against Koh.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     It was apparent that the accused persons tried to restrain Khevin. Buvan’s evidence was that he confronted Khevin at the lorry area and tried to “control” him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> According to Sivakumar, he saw the four accused persons trying to get hold of Khevin. He saw Kumar, Buvan and Subramaniam hold and grip Khevin’s upper arm and forearm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Subramaniam also testified to this effect but was evasive about whether Khevin hit anybody apart from Kumar. He stated:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    Now, at the lorry area, did Khevin hit anybody?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    At the lorry area, Khevin became aggressive, he was struggling, and Buvan and Koh --- Buvan and Koh was trying to hold him. He --- he was in a very rowdy way. He was trying to struggle.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    Okay. So you didn’t see Mr Khevin assault or hit anyone at the lorry area, Mr Subramaniam?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    That’s what I said earlier. He punched Boss Kumar.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    Okay, he punched Mr Sashikumar once according to your testimony. Apart from that, did he do anything to anybody else?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    He was behaving in this --- he was behaving in this rowdy manner and he was trying to struggle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     From the evidence of the defence witnesses, the picture which emerged was that the accused persons tried (as Sivakumar put it), to get hold of Khevin. This would explain why Khevin had to struggle. Throughout the incident, Khevin had only attempted to defend himself. Subramaniam confirmed this in his police statement (Exhibit P26):-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q14)  How did [Khevin] react when the 4 of you were assaulting him?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A14)  He was very aggressive and turned very violent. He punched Kumar on the face. Thereafter, when the 4 of us were surrounding him, he was defending himself and throwing random punches to keep us away from him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Thus, when the four accused persons surrounded Khevin, he was forced to defend himself by throwing punches to keep them at bay. This fitted in with Khevin’s account that the four accused persons attacked him.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim that the accused persons wanted to apprehend Khevin and hand him to the police was unbelievable</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The accused persons claimed that they intended to apprehend Khevin and hand him over to the police. For example, Kumar claimed in examination-in-chief that after he found out about the molest, “All of us were only trying to --- our best to catch all of him and call the police.” However, Khevin “manage to go away from us”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> This was a flimsy claim. As a matter of logic, in order to hand Khevin over to the police, the police would have to be called. Since none of the accused persons called the police, the claim that they intended to apprehend Khevin to hand him to the police was absurd.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The accused persons encountered two security officers at level 6 but failed to seek assistance from either of them. Instead, it appeared that they wanted the guards to leave quickly. Devamani, who was one of the security guards, testified that when Woman Senior Security Officer Rani enquired about what the problem was and why it was so noisy, Kumar told her that this was a work problem and asked her not to interfere. Kumar also told them to leave.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Kumar’s charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The particulars of Kumar’s charges were as follows:-</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     He used certain Tamil words to threaten Khevin; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     He punched Khevin several times on his forehead and cheeks.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Kumar threatened Khevin</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The prosecution alleged that outside the office, Kumar threatened Khevin in Tamil with the intention of causing alarm. The translation of the threat as stated in the charge was as follows:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are all from Ang Heng brothers. We are wanted in Singapore. You are just a kid. What do you know? I know 21. I know 08. All of them are my friends. Do you know that we are Ang Soon Thong brothers? I have member in Malaysia as well. Do you want to see my Malaysian members? Do you want to meet Malaysian members?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Khevin testified that Kumar made the threats angrily and aggressively when they were standing face to face outside the office. The threats included, “We are ‘Ah Heng’ brothers. That we are wanted persons in Singapore. That he has members in Malaysia. That he had 08 and 21. Whether I wanted to meet his brothers”. He further described the threats as, “That he knows 08, he knows 21, he knows ‘Ang Soon Thong’, ‘Ah Heng’. He said that “Who are you? You are --- you are a small boy. What do you know about me?” He said “Do you want to jumpa [meet] my members?”” Upon hearing the words, Khevin became frightened and started perspiring.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     While there were some differences between Khevin’s evidence and the words stated in the charge, these were expected and not material. I was satisfied that the gist or effect of what Kumar was alleged to have said was properly captured in the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Khevin and Kumar gave different accounts of what happened outside the office. As I rejected the claim that Khevin molested Priya, Kumar’s claim that he confronted Khevin over the molest was not plausible. Instead, Khevin’s version that the barrage of threats was sparked off when Khevin lit a cigarette was far more compelling.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Khevin’s account was partially corroborated by the case for the defence. The then defence counsel Mr Edmond Pereira put to Khevin that when he lit a cigarette during the confrontation, Kumar told him not to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> This supported Khevin’s testimony that Kumar had an issue about him lighting up a cigarette. Despite what was put by counsel, Kumar and the other accused persons failed to mention that there was a confrontation over a cigarette. This omission was material and undermined the accused persons’ narrative of how the events unfolded.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Given the factual matrix, I accepted Khevin’s account that after he lit the cigarette, Kumar threatened him with the Tamil words stated in the charge and that he was frightened by the threat.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Kumar punched Khevin on his forehead and cheeks</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Khevin testified that after Kumar threatened him, Kumar held on to his neck with his left hand, and punched his face with his right hand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> At the lorry area, Kumar held on to his neck very tightly and pulled the orange string (Exhibit P15) off his jacket. Kumar then punched him on his forehead, cheeks and mouth. Kumar was wearing rings, and this caused Khevin to bleed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Dr Namthep testified that the injuries sustained by Khevin were consistent with him being punched multiple times on his forehead and cheeks.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Kumar admitted in court that he punched Khevin once or twice outside the office and that he punched Khevin in the face. He gave four statements to the police (Exhibits P21 to P24) which were admitted without challenge. In all the statements, Kumar admitted that he punched Khevin, but maintained that this was in self-defence. The statements made it clear that he punched Khevin more than once. For example, in Exhibit P23, he stated, “When I happened to punch him on his face, it was unfortunate that the punches landed with my rings on my finger.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Khevin’s claim that Kumar also punched him at the lorry area was supported by the defence witnesses. Buvan testified that Khevin tried to snatch Kumar’s gold chain which snapped. Khevin then punched Kumar in his cheekbone and Kumar punched Khevin. Koh testified that at the lorry area, Khevin hit all of them. He hit Kumar first and Kumar retaliated. Sivakumar also testified that Kumar punched Khevin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     There was thus ample evidence to show that Kumar punched Khevin several times on his forehead and cheeks, as alleged in the charge. I will deal with Kumar’s claim that he acted in self-defence below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subramaniam’s charge</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subramaniam punched Khevin several times on his forehead and cheeks</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Subramaniam’s charge alleged that he punched Khevin several times on his forehead and cheeks. Khevin testified that Subramaniam punched him on both cheeks, his mouth area and the side of his forehead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Subramaniam admitted in court that he punched Khevin several times on his forehead, cheeks and below his mouth.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> In his statement to the police recorded on 2 May 2017 (Exhibit P26), Subramaniam confessed to assaulting Khevin. He stated, “I punched Khevin a few times on his forehead and cheeks. I did not assault him further”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> Buvan, Koh and Sivakumar also saw Subramaniam punching Khevin.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     There was thus no doubt that Subramaniam punched Khevin several times on his forehead and cheeks. He claimed that he intervened to protect Kumar who was intoxicated. For reasons which will be stated below, I rejected Subramaniam’s claim that he acted in the defence of Kumar.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subramaniam’s police report and Magistrate’s complaint were not relevant</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Subramaniam made certain allegations about Khevin’s post-assault conduct. He made a police report on 11 April 2017 (Exhibit D6) and filed a Magistrate’s complaint on 4 August 2017 (Exhibit D11). He claimed that Khevin called him on multiple occasions and harassed him, scolded him with vulgarities and challenged him to a meeting. Khevin boasted that he was a secret society member who was wanted by the Malaysian police. Subramaniam further claimed that when he was at a food court at 11 Woodlands Close on 7 July 2017, a group of Malaysians stared at him and called out his name.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Exhibits D6 and D11 were not relevant and I placed no weight on them. They related to events which occurred after the assault and did not shed any light on what had occurred.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Telephone recordings were not relevant</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Subramaniam testified that Khevin called him from KTPH that evening. Khevin said that if Kumar gave him $10,000 immediately, he would not report the matter. Khevin called the next day and said that if Kumar gave him $5,000, he would not go to Jurong Police Station. Even if Khevin had made such demands, this was not a material consideration. There was ample evidence to show that he suffered multiple injuries. This was not a case where he fabricated his injuries to attempt to extort money.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The defence also tendered recordings of telephone conversations. This included a conversation between Khevin and Subramaniam (Anand) (Exhibit D13), which was recorded when Subramaniam was at the police station. The transcript showed that both of them uttered abusive language at each other. There was a reference to compensation of $10,000, but this was not probative of anything.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     All these were not relevant to the charges and did not cast any doubt on the prosecution’s case. I noted however, that when Khevin alleged that he was beaten and stones thrown at him, Subramaniam failed to deny this.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Buvan’s charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The particulars of the charge against Buvan provided that he used a broken piece of the lion statue to hit Khevin’s head and punched Khevin on his left shoulder. Buvan denied doing either of these.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Buvan was an evasive witness who sought to minimize his own role and the roles played by the other accused persons. For example, although it was abundantly clear from CCTV footage that Koh had forcefully pushed Khevin towards the lorry area, Buvan claimed that, “As Khevin moved backwards, Ah Tiang [Koh] followed in his footsteps…”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Buvan’s claim that Subramaniam punched Khevin to defend himself and Kumar<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> was also devoid of merit. He was clearly tailoring his evidence as he could not have known Subramaniam’s intention. Further, Subramaniam was not hurt and never claimed that he punched Khevin to defend himself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Buvan was by no means an innocent by-stander, but an active participant. In Exhibit P26, Subramaniam stated that Buvan was shouting at the top of his voice at Khevin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> By his own admission, when Kumar came down from the office with Khevin, he went towards Khevin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> By entering the lorry area to confront Khevin, Buvan also showed his aggressive behaviour. Subsequently, together with Koh, he went to “control” Khevin. This resulted in a scuffle involving the three of them.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Buvan hit Khevin on the back of his head with a piece of the lion statue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Khevin’s evidence that Buvan hit him on the back of his head with a piece of the lion statue was compelling and persuasive. He was only a few feet away when this happened. His evidence was not shaken in cross-examination. He gave a consistent account throughout. W/SSS Shalini who was one of the first police officers to arrive at the scene, noticed that Khevin was bleeding from the right side of the back of his head. He told her that Buvan had taken an ornament and smashed it on the back of his head.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> The same observation was made by SSgt Adnan who arrived with her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Dr Namthep testified that Khevin suffered an injury to the external right ear with bruising and swelling. He stated that there was an abrasion (a superficial injury to the skin) of 2 cm by 2 cm behind Khevin’s right ear (see photographs marked Exhibits P3.8 to P3.10). There was some minor bleeding which had stopped, but no active bleeding from the abrasion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> While Dr Namthep agreed that it was possible that the injury behind the ear was not a fresh one, there was no doubt that Khevin was injured at that area, since both police officers observed Khevin bleeding from there.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Buvan punched Khevin on his left shoulder</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Next, I turn to the issue of whether Buvan punched Khevin on his left shoulder. Khevin did not state that this happened, but as the situation was chaotic, he may not have realized that Buvan punched him there. However, Subramaniam testified that when he punched Khevin two to three times, Buvan (whom he referred to as “George”) also punched Khevin:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">When this was happening, Khevin was trying to punch ‘George’ [Buvan]. At this point, ‘George’ pushed his hand away and punched his shoulder portion. Khevin’s shoulder portion.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Subramaniam attempted to retract his testimony in cross-examination and claimed that Buvan only tapped Khevin’s shoulder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> This claim was untruthful, since his position all along was that Buvan punched Khevin in his shoulder. He stated in his police statement which was recorded on 6 April 2017 (Exhibit P25) that “George [Buvan] then went to punch Khevin on his left shoulder.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> He confirmed in Exhibit P26 that he saw Buvan punching Khevin (referred to as Kelvin) on his left shoulder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> He further stated in Exhibit P26:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q12)  How did George [Buvan] assault Kelvin?</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A12)  George was shouting at his top voice towards Kelvin. I do remember George punching Kelvin at Kelvin’s shoulder. George was also tipsy at that moment as he was drinking alcohol before the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Exhibits P25 and P26 were admitted without challenge. I accepted that the statements were properly recorded and that Subramaniam told the police that Buvan punched Khevin on his left shoulder. His claim that he said that Buvan tapped Khevin’s shoulder was an afterthought. The word “punched” is a common word and it was unlikely that the recorders could have got it wrong. When Subramaniam testified in examination-in-chief that Buvan punched Khevin, there was no reason to doubt the accuracy of this, since his evidence was interpreted by a certified Tamil court interpreter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    There was no reason for Subramaniam to lie about what Buvan did, or for the court to doubt his account of what he witnessed. I therefore found that Buvan had punched Khevin on his left shoulder.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Koh’s charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Koh’s original charge alleged that he used a wooden broomstick to hit Khevin twice on his back and that he punched Khevin in the face. At the end of trial, I amended the charge by deleting references to the assault with the wooden broomstick. Koh was convicted on an amended charge of punching Khevin in the face. I will provide brief reasons for the amendment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    After Khevin was assaulted, Subramaniam, Koh and Priya swept up the mess from the lion statute. CCTV footage showed that they took a broomstick from the office. Khevin identified the broomstick used for cleaning as the same broomstick which was used on him. However, video evidence showed that at the time of the assault, no one had brought the broomstick from the office to the lorry area. The first time the broomstick appeared was when it was brought out to clean the mess. There was therefore some doubt as to whether it was possible for Koh to have assaulted Khevin with the broomstick. The charge was thus amended to delete references to the broomstick and the assault associated with it.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Koh punched Khevin in his face</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Khevin’s account was that Koh held on to his neck or collar and pushed him to the lorry area. Koh then punched his face. Koh admitted to pushing Khevin but denied punching him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Koh was a private car driver who did work for Evershine. He was just there to collect his money. What occurred between Evershine and its employees should have been none of his concern. Yet, he got involved as he felt that Khevin was rude to Kumar. They were speaking in Tamil and he would not even have understood what they said. When he saw Khevin talking and gesturing, “I stood up. I went over and I --- I pushed Khevin aside and asked what was happening. I asked why he was talking to his boss in this manner.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> According to Subramaniam, Khevin and Koh then started to push each other.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The video evidence showed Koh pushing Khevin across the driveway. The push lasted several seconds and covered several metres. Koh held on to Khevin’s neck or collar area. In so doing, Koh had certainly used criminal force on Khevin. Khevin’s claim that Koh punched him in his face thereafter was persuasive. Given Koh’s aggressive frame of mind, it would not be any surprise that he would top off his aggressive push with a punch.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    If Koh did not in fact punch Khevin, I would have found it appropriate to further amend the particulars of the charge. By forcefully pushing Khevin to the lorry area after Kumar punched Khevin’s face, Koh demonstrated that he was very much involved in Khevin’s assault and shared the common intention to do so. Alternatively, I would have amended the charge to one of using criminal force, punishable under s 352 of the PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused persons were not entitled to rely on the right of private defence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">General principles</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Sections 96 and 97 of the PC provide:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Nothing done in private defence is an offence</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">96.    Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Right of private defence of the body and of property</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">97.    Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In <em>Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/57911-M.xml')">[2008] SGCA 32</a> (<em>“Tan Chor Jin”</em>), the Court of Appeal held at [46] that to succeed in a claim of private defence, the accused must demonstrate:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_a"></a>(a)     An offence affecting the human body has been committed or is reasonably apprehended;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_b"></a>(b)     From an objective point of view, there was no time to seek the protection of the public authorities;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_c"></a>(c)     Subjectively, the accused must have reasonably apprehended danger due to an attempt or threat by the victim to commit an offence affecting the human body; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_d"></a>(d)     The harm caused to the victim was reasonably necessary in private defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In order to succeed in the claim of private defence, the burden would be on the accused persons to prove on a balance of probabilities that they were entitled to exercise it.

Under these circumstances, it was difficult to see what threat Kumar was defending himself against or how he could rely on private defence. By his own case, he retaliated when Khevin punched him. It was put to Khevin by the then defence counsel, Mr Edmond Pereira that:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    I put to you that use --- challenge Sashikumar to a fight and you assaulted Sashikumar and Sashikumar hit you in retaliation to your assault, agree or disagree.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    I disagree.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    As Kumar “retaliated” against Khevin, this would mean that he took revenge and returned Khevin’s punch with a punch. The defence failed to establish how by retaliating and extracting revenge, Kumar was acting in private defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    It was later put to Khevin that when he tried to snatch Kumar’s gold chain, Kumar managed to hold on to it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> It was then put to Khevin that after he punched Kumar, Kumar punched him in retaliation:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" frame="none" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="13.1%"/> <col width="86.9%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Q</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">I put it to you, Sashikumar stopped you from pulling off his chain which broke off and you punched Sashikumar when he was unguarded --- unguarded.</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">[clarification of question by interpreter].</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Pereira</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Yah.

This was different from asserting that he needed to use reasonable force to prevent the theft of his gold chain.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subramaniam’s claim that he acted to protect Kumar was incredible</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Subramaniam did not claim that Khevin hit him. His defence was that he punched Khevin in order to protect Kumar who was drunk. He testified that after Koh pushed Khevin to the lorry area, the following occurred:-<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Because Kumar had taken a bit more drinks, he wasn’t very steady. While this conversation was going on, this is when Khevin first punched Kumar. This was about 2 to 3 times. It was at this point I intervened. Khevin tried to punch me, and I stopped him and I punched him 2 times ---2 or 3 times.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The impression Subramaniam sought to convey was that he acted to defend Kumar who was too drunk to defend himself. This claim had no merit. Kumar’s account showed that he could fend for himself. When Khevin allegedly punched him, he was able to retaliate and punch Khevin back. He claimed to be able to question Khevin over molesting Priya. According to Subramaniam, Kumar and Khevin spoke for about 40 seconds at the lorry area before further trouble broke out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> This did not give the impression that Kumar was so intoxicated that he could not defend himself. The CCTV footage showed that Kumar was able to walk steadily and unaided. In fact, once everything was over, Kumar even drove off in his car.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    I therefore found Subramaniam’s claim that he punched Khevin to protect Kumar to be dubious.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The right of private defence did not apply to Buvan and Koh</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Both Buvan and Koh denied assaulting Khevin in the manner stated in their charges. Since they denied the specific acts, they could not demonstrate how those acts were necessary in the exercise of private defence. Buvan did not explain how hitting Khevin with a piece of lion statue or punching Khevin’s shoulder could support his claim of self-defence. Similarly, Koh did not show how punching Khevin in his face contributed towards his private defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    I will nonetheless address the application of <em>Tan Chor Jin</em> to their cases as well.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conditions set out in Tan Chor Jin were not satisfied</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Khevin did not commit an offence affecting the human body. Instead, Kumar and the other accused persons were the aggressors and had assaulted him first. By their account, Khevin even tried to run away or escape. From a subjective view, the accused persons could not have reasonably apprehended any danger from Khevin.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In any event, the accused persons had ample time to seek the protection of the public authorities. When Koh pushed Khevin across the driveway, the other accused persons could have remained at Evershine’s side and called the police. However, none of them did so. Instead, they chose to escalate matters by entering the lorry area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    While Khevin suffered multiple injuries, none of the accused persons had any significant injury. There was a wide disparity in the injuries, with Khevin’s injuries being much more serious. Even if Khevin tried to snatch Kumar’s gold chain, the accused persons failed to show why they needed to use such a large amount of force, so as to cause him multiple injuries. By his own account, Kumar had managed to secure his gold chain, so that Khevin could not have gotten away with it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    On the totality of the evidence, the accused persons were not entitled to rely on private defence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue of common intention</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Whether a common intention existed would be inferred from all the facts and circumstances of the case. In this respect, the prosecution’s case theory that the accused persons had a pre-arranged plan to assault Khevin was extravagant, since there was no evidence to suggest this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> If anything, the common intention was formed spontaneously. Once Kumar reacted to Khevin’s slight and punched him, the other accused persons joined in the attack. Although the role played by each of them was different, the circumstances clearly showed that they intended to jointly attack Khevin. In these circumstances, a common intention to assault Khevin could easily be inferred.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Finding of guilt</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    For the reasons aforesaid, the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving all the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

See, J further stated (at [78]) that in sentencing an offender under s 323, the court should undertake a two-step inquiry:-</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the court should identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence. This would allow the court to derive the appropriate indicative starting point.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_b"></a>(b)     Next, the court should make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors. This may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range. The aggravating and mitigating factors identified in <em>BDB</em> at [62] to [70] and [71] to [75] respectively are relevant at this step.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The first step under <em>Low Song Chye</em> would be to determine the appropriate starting point for sentence by considering the hurt Khevin suffered. While he suffered several contusions and abrasions, the injuries were not major, and he was discharged from KTPH after six hours.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Khevin’s claim that he lost consciousness in the ambulance<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> was questionable. Although the Triage Notes (see Exhibit P2) indicated that Khevin lost consciousness for three minutes, the primary diagnosis was “Concussion with no loss of consciousness”. According to Dr Namthep, Khevin was fully conscious and alert when he was examined. Khevin had also told Dr Ranjeev (who was the senior doctor) that there was no loss of consciousness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> Due to these conflicting accounts, I was not prepared to hold that Khevin had lost consciousness. Even if he did, this was for a relatively short period.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Khevin was given five days’ medical leave, which was a significant period. Considering the nature of the injuries, I was of the view that this case fell at the borderline of Bands 1 and 2 prescribed in <em>Low Song Chye</em>. I assessed the appropriate starting point to be four weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    There were several common aggravating factors. This was a sustained group attack lasting about four minutes. Khevin was assaulted on his head, which is a vulnerable part of his body. In view of the aggravating factors, an uplift of four weeks’ imprisonment for each accused person was necessary. The base sentence (which included a consideration of common aggravating factors) would therefore be eight weeks’ imprisonment. I also noted that none of the accused persons showed any remorse.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    I will now deal with the individual sentences meted out to the accused persons, starting with the lowest sentence. This would entail a consideration of any additional aggravating factors as well as mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Buvan’s sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Buvan had no antecedents. It was an additional aggravating factor that he used a piece of the lion statue as a weapon to hit Khevin’s head. The prosecution sought a sentence of at least ten weeks’ imprisonment for Buvan.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The defence submitted that ordinarily, the appropriate sentence would be four weeks imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> However, it prayed that this should be calibrated downwards to a fine of $5000 due to Buvan’s poor health. Buvan had various health issues, the most serious of which was kidney failure. He had to go for dialysis three times a week. He needed a kidney transplant. The defence asserted that he would suffer disproportionately as compared to other prisoners and asked for judicial mercy.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The prosecution informed the court that the Singapore Prison Services would be able to manage Buvan’s condition and ensure his health would not be adversely affected. It contended that sentence should not be reduced on account of his poor health.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    In my opinion, this was not an appropriate case for judicial mercy, which was only intended for the most exceptional cases. However, I was prepared to consider Buvan’s illness to be a good mitigating factor, since the physical and mental hardship caused by a term of imprisonment would likely be greater than for other prisoners. I therefore calibrated his sentence downwards to four weeks’ imprisonment and sentenced him as such.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Koh’s sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Koh had a similar antecedent which was an offender-specific aggravating factor. He was convicted on 6 February 2015 of an offence under s 323 of the PC. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,000. The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 12 weeks’ imprisonment. In his plea-in-mitigation, defence counsel claimed that the present offence occurred on the spur of the moment. He re-iterated Koh’s defence and did not raise any significant mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In my assessment, from the baseline of eight weeks’ imprisonment, a two-week uplift should be imposed because of Koh’s previous conviction for a similar offence. He failed to learn his lesson and some form of specific deterrence was necessary. I therefore sentenced Koh to 10 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subramaniam’s other charge and sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    After he was convicted on the VCH charge, Subramaniam pleaded guilty to the following theft charge:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><u>Amended 5<sup>th</sup> charge (MAC-906414-2017)</u></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">are charged that you, on the 1st day of July 2017, at or about 10.30 a.m., inside motor vehicle GX1848E, parked at the carpark of No. 11 Woodlands Close, level 6, Singapore, did commit theft of one cash card, valued at S$37.00, in the possession of Lim Kok Ming, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 379 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In summary, the Statement of Facts showed that Subramaniam stretched his hand through an open window of a lorry and stole the cash card from the IU unit. The cash card had a balance of $37.00, which he used to purchase food, drinks and daily necessities from a Prime Supermarket and a 7-Eleven store. He then threw the cash card into a bin.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    As for his criminal record, Subramaniam was on 21 October 2009, convicted on two counts of robbery, punishable under section 392 of the PC. He was sentenced to three years and six months’ imprisonment per charge (to run concurrently) and to a total of 12 strokes of the cane. He was also sentenced to three months’ imprisonment (to run consecutively) for personating a public servant, punishable under s 170 of the PC. One further count each of robbery, snatch theft, theft and voluntarily causing hurt were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    The prosecution submitted that Subramaniam had the same level of culpability as Buvan and Koh. It sought a sentence of at least 16 weeks’ imprisonment for the VCH charge, and a consecutive sentence of at least 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the theft charge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> The defence submitted that a fine should be imposed as low harm was caused to Khevin. No significant mitigating factors were raised.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In view of Subramaniam’s antecedents and to ensure parity with Koh’s sentence, I sentenced him to 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the VCH charge, being an uplift of two weeks from the base of eight weeks’ imprisonment. For the s 379 charge, although the amount stolen ($37.00) was relatively small, a short custodial sentence was necessary due to Subramaniam’s antecedents. I imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment, to run consecutively. Subramaniam’s aggregate sentence would therefore be 12 weeks’ imprisonment. In my view, this was just and proportional to the crimes he committed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Kumar’s other charge and sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    After he was convicted of the VCH offence, Kumar pleaded guilty to the following charge:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><u>MAC 907334-2017 (Amended 3<sup>rd</sup> charge)</u></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">are charged that you, on the 18th day of August 2017, at about 4.30pm, at the Hougang Neighbourhood Police Centre, Blk 60 Hougang Ave 9, Singapore 538775, which is a public place, did behave in a disorderly manner to wit, by shouting loudly repeatedly, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    The Statement of Facts relating to this charge stated that on 18 August 2017 at about 3.00 p.m., Priya walked into Hougang Neighbourhood Police Centre (“the NPC”) and insisted on being arrested. She refused to leave, even though she was told that there was no reason to arrest her. The police then contacted Kumar who went to the NPC. He tried to convince Priya to go home but she refused. A team leader at the NPC then spoke to Kumar to try to understand the situation better. However, at about 4.30 p.m., Kumar became agitated. He raised his voice and pointed his fingers at the said team leader. He was warned several times but continued to shout loudly. He was then arrested for disorderly behaviour.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Kumar did not have similar antecedents. The prosecution submitted that Kumar was the most culpable as he initiated the attack on Khevin. Further, he was subject to supervision under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provision) Act (“CLTPA”). By s 35 of the CLTPA, for the VCH and criminal intimidation offences, he was liable to a term of imprisonment which was two times the prescribed sentences and to caning (“enhanced punishment”). The enhanced punishment did not apply to the offence of disorderly behaviour.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 16 weeks’ imprisonment for the VCH charge (which included an uplift of two weeks for the enhanced punishment), three weeks’ imprisonment for the criminal intimidation charge and two weeks’ imprisonment for the disorderly behaviour charge. It submitted that all sentences should run consecutively so that the aggregate sentence would be at least 21 weeks’ imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In his plea-in-mitigation, counsel informed the court that Kumar had worked extremely hard to build up various businesses and employed 30 people. He supported his mother and mentally ill elder brother. He was also involved in a religious charity and other charitable causes. The defence submitted for a custodial sentence of not more than six weeks’ imprisonment, being six weeks’ imprisonment for the VCH charge and one week’s imprisonment for the criminal intimidation charge, with both sentences to run concurrently. It also submitted for a fine of $1,000 for the disorderly behaviour charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    From the base of eight weeks’ imprisonment for the VCH charge, I imposed an uplift of two weeks’ imprisonment for the enhanced punishment, so that sentence would be 10 weeks’ imprisonment. Kumar was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment for the criminal intimidation charge and a further two weeks’ imprisonment for the disorderly behaviour charge. As compared to the other accused persons, Kumar was the most culpable. To reflect his overall culpability, I ordered that all his sentences should run consecutively, so that he would serve a total of 14 weeks’ imprisonment. In my view the total sentence was just and proportional to the offences he committed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Compensation Orders</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The court also ordered that each accused person pay Khevin compensation in the sum of $500 or in default to two days’ imprisonment. No appeals have been lodged against the compensation orders.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>NE day 5, page 60 lines 29-32;
