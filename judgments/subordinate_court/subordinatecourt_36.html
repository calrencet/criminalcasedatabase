A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offences for the proceeded charges reads as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>ARREST &amp; INVESTIGATIONS</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    On 24 April 2017, at about 8.56 a.m., an arrangement was made between the accused and Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) undercover officer Lim Jun Jie (“Lim”) to meet at the McDonald’s outlet at Bugis Junction, as Lim had placed an order for 0.5 grams of ‘ice’ (the street name for methamphetamine) from the accused for S$100.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    On the same day, 11.27 a.m., at the pre-arranged location, the accused met up with Lim and passed the ‘ice’ (marked as “A1A”) to Lim. The accused was then arrested by CNB officers. 2 fifty-dollar notes, which were handed by Lim to the accused, were also recovered from the accused. Officers also conducted a search on him and found two packets of crystalline substance (marked as “C1A”) in his bag. The accused admitted ownership to the drugs seized and revealed the drugs found in his bag were meant for his own consumption.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The accused was then brought to his official residence at Blk 351 Tampines Street 33 #XXX, Singapore for a raid, where other drug exhibits were seized. The accused was then escorted to CNB office at Marina Bay Cruise Centre, Singapore for further investigations.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 2ND CHARGE (DAC 913707-2017)</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    On 26 April 2017, exhibit “A1A” was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for analysis.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    On 5 June 2017, Dr Lee Hui Zhi Shirley, an analyst with the Illicit Drug Laboratory of HSA, issued a certificate under section 16 of the Misuse of Drug Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (MDA) bearing Lab No: ID-1732-00797-001, stating that exhibit “A1A” was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.57 grams of crystalline substance which analysed and found to contain <b>not less than 0.38 grams of methamphetamine</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    During the course of investigations, the accused admitted that he had sold one packet of ‘cream’ (which also refers to methamphetamine) to Lim for $100 on the day of his arrest. The accused further admitted that he would earn $50 profit by selling $100 worth of ‘cream’ to Lim. He had sold ‘cream’ to Lim on two occasions in total, and had last sold $100 worth of ‘cream’ (marked as “UC-3A”) to Lim on 22 April 2017. He admitted that he would sell ‘cream’ to Lim and his other friends to make some money and also as a way to meet new sexual partners. The accused began selling ‘cream’ sometime in February 2017 and his customers are mostly homosexual males.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    The accused is not authorized under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to traffic exhibit “A1A” by selling it to Lim and has thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a), punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>FACTS RELATING TO THE 3RD CHARGE (DAC913708-17)</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    On 26 April 2017, exhibit “C1A” was sent to the HSA for analysis.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    On 5 June 2017, Dr Lee Hui Zhi Shirley, an analyst with the Illicit Drug Laboratory of HSA, issued a certificate under section 16 of the MDA bearing the Lab No: ID-1732-00797-002, stating that exhibit “C1A” was found to be two packets containing not less than 0.52 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain <b>not less than 0.34 grams of methamphetamine</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    During the course of investigations, the accused admitted that exhibit “C1A” was ‘cream’ for his own personal consumption.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    The accused is not authorized to have in his possession exhibit “C1A” under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder and has thereby committed an offence under section 8(a), punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>FACTS RELATING TO THE 4th CHARGE (DAC 915458-2017)</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    On 24 April 2017, at Marina Bay Cruise Centre, the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples, which were sealed ‘CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU’ and respectively marked ‘CMI-17-00007-1 JAMES LAWRENCE CHARLES SXXX’ and ‘C-MI-17-00007-2 JAMES LAWRENCE CHARLES SXXX’ in his presence. The said urine samples were sent to the HSA on 25 April 2017 for analysis.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    On 27 April 2017 and 28 April 2017, HSA issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA, bearing Lab No: AT-1733-03598-001-03 and AT-1733-03598-002-03 respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    Ms Ng Xue Qin, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked ‘C-MI-17-00007-1 JAMES LAWRENCE CHARLES SXXX’, issued the certificate bearing Lab No: AT-1733-03598-001-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain <b>methamphetamine</b>.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    Ms Goh Mei Ling Evelyn, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked ‘C-MI-17-00007-2 JAMES LAWRENCE CHARLES SXXX’, issued the certificate bearing Lab No: AT-1733-03598-002-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain <b>methamphetamine</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    During the course of investigations, the accused admitted that he had consumed ‘cream’ on the morning of 24 April 2017, in his bedroom. He admitted that he would place some ‘cream’ in a pipe (which is attached to a glass bong) and used a lighter to heat up the bottom of the pipe. He would then inhale the smokes emitted from the bong. The accused had started smoking ‘cream’ since October 2016 and would do so daily. He would purchase ‘cream’ from one “Justin” in Johor Bahru, Malaysia for approximately 1500 Malaysian Ringgit per 12 grams of ‘cream’. The accused admitted that he would consume ‘cream’ to relieve his stress, and also for sexual enhancement. His urine samples were therefore found to contain methamphetamine as a result of the accused consumption of ‘cream’.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.    The accused is not authorized to consume methamphetamine under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder, and had thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii), punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    …</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The accused was traced for dissimilar non-drug related convictions. On 28 April 2001 and 5 June 2012, he was convicted for theft and fined $500 and $600 respectively. On 4 January 2003, he was convicted for theft in dwelling and sentenced to two months’ imprisonment. This was not disputed by the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For the purpose of his drug related offences here, I had treated him as a first offender.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Prosecution orally submitted for the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by law in respect of the trafficking charge. This was taking into consideration the weight of the methamphetamine involved. Methamphetamine is a Class A drug under the MDA. Additionally, the Prosecution sought for an additional 10 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of the mandatory minimum five strokes of cane, i.e. two weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of each stroke of the cane, as the accused could not be caned due to his age.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     For the possession charge and consumption charge, the Prosecution sought for the usual benchmark sentences of between 9 to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge and for one of the charges to run consecutively with the trafficking charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Defence tendered a written mitigation on behalf of the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     At the outset, the Defence orally submitted that it had no issues with the individual sentences as well as the global sentence sought for by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Defence agreed that the Prosecution’s submissions were in line with the facts of the present case as the accused was not a professional or part of a drug syndicate, the quantity of the drugs involved was small and they were primarily for his own consumption. He was also a first offender in respect of drug related offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In terms of the accused’s personal circumstances, the Defence highlighted that the accused was a divorcee and lives alone. He has no relatives in Singapore and has received up to ‘O’ levels education. He was also unemployed, having previously worked as a service manager in a hotel and marketing agent in health products.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In January 2017, the accused felt depressed and lonely. Hence, when the accused’s friends introduced him to drugs, he became addicted. Unfortunately, he needed money to feed his drug consumption. Sometimes, he would buy the drugs at a larger quantity and sell it to his friends to reduce the price of the drugs and save on costs. The trafficking offence was committed purely to feed his drug consumption habits.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The accused has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and cooperated fully with the authorities after his arrest.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Unfortunately, after the accused was arrested, he became ill. The Defence tendered the accused medical memo from TTSH dated 2 August 2017. This indicated that the accused was diagnosed with asymptomatic HIV infection. He also has a history of hepatitis B, syphilis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and latent tuberculosis infection.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As such, a custodial sentence of almost six years would certainly serve as a severe punishment for the accused due to his offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Possession charge and consumption charge </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The sentences for these two charges were uncontroversial. Both the Prosecution and Defence were in general agreement with the length of the custodial sentence to be imposed for each of the charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In any case, the individual sentence of nine months’ imprisonment was at the lower end of the usual benchmark sentence submitted by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For the possession charge, based on the fact that the quantity of methamphetamine(which is a Class A controlled drug under the MDA) found in the possession of the accused at the material time was not more than two grams and taking into consideration another possession charge, the sentence of <u>nine months’ imprisonment</u> could not be said to be manifestly excess.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For the consumption charge, I had taken into account that methamphetamine was a Class A controlled drug under the MDA and the accused was a drug addict as admitted by him in mitigation. He could not be described as a one-off or casual drug user. Again, the sentence of <u>nine months’ imprisonment</u> could not be said to be manifestly excess.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Trafficking charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     For the trafficking charge, I had imposed on the accused <u>the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment</u> required under s 33(1) read with Second Schedule of the MDA for a Class A controlled drug.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, pursuant to s 325(1)(b) of the CPC, the accused could be caned as he was above 50 years old at the time of sentence. Hence, the mandatory minimum number of five strokes of the cane was not imposed on the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The issue here was whether I should have imposed the additional 10 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of caning on the accused and if so, was it manifestly excessive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     S 325(1) and (2) of the CPC states:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    Execution of sentence of caning forbidden in certain cases</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">325.—(1)    The following persons shall not be punished with caning:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    women;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    men who are more than 50 years of age at the time of infliction of the caning; and</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    men sentenced to death whose sentences have not been commuted.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Subject to any other written law, if a person is convicted of one or more offences punishable with caning (referred to in this section as the relevant offences) but the person cannot be caned because subsection (1)(a) or (b) applies, <em>the court may, in addition to any other punishment to which that person has been sentenced, impose a term of imprisonment of not more than 12 months in lieu of the caning</em> which it could, but for this section, have ordered in respect of the relevant offences. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the High Court’s decision of <em>PP v Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18769-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 66</a>, it was held at [35] –[36]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[35]  Pursuant to s 33(1) and the Second Schedule of the MDA, a person convicted for the unauthorised importation of not less than 167g but not more than 250g of methamphetamine would be given the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane. However, because the accused is a woman, she was not liable for caning (as per s 325(1) of the CPC). In <em>Yap Siew Luan</em> ([7] <em>supra</em>), I imposed an additional two years of imprisonment on an accused person in lieu of caning because she was female. That case must now be read subject to s 325(2) of the CPC, which provides that the maximum imprisonment term that may be imposed in lieu of caning is 12 months.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[36]   <em>In my opinion, the court should consider imposing an additional imprisonment term in respect of offenders who are exempted from caning unless there are special circumstances that justify doing otherwise.</em> As I have stated in <em>PP v Kisshahllini a/p Paramesuvaran</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18924-SSP.xml')">[2016] 3 SLR 261</a>, which also concerned the unauthorised importation of a controlled drug by a female and which was heard one day before the present case, <em>the purpose is to deter individuals to whom this exemption applies from being involved in the drugs trade. The most dreaded form of punishment is probably caning. For the present offence, caning is not discretionary</em> and it is set at 15 strokes, which is significantly high considering that the maximum number of strokes that can be inflicted on an offender at any one time is 24. Given the severity of the mandatory punishment of 15 strokes of the cane for non-exempted offenders, the maximum of 12 months’ imprisonment should be added if an offender is exempted from caning, even if an additional 12 months might not appear to make a big difference when viewed against the minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. <em>In this case, I see no special circumstances to justify otherwise. This is to ensure that such exempted persons have less incentive to be involved in the drugs trade</em>. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Prosecution submitted that the typical sentence imposed in lieu of caning is two weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of each stroke of the cane. As the accused could not be caned due to his age, the Prosecution was of the view that 10 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of the mandatory minimum of 5 strokes of the cane under s 33(1) of the MDA was warranted.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I agreed with the Prosecution that there were really no special circumstances in the present case for the court to justify not imposing the additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In coming to my decision to impose the additional imprisonment sentence in lieu of caning, I considered several relevant factors before me. The purpose of s 325(2) of the CPC is to ensure that exempted persons under s 325(1) of the CPC have less incentive to be involved in the drug trade, which is a serious offence that affects public order, health and safety.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Moreover, the accused was already over the age of 50 years old when he committed the present offences. Hence, when he committed the offences, the accused already knew or ought to have known that he was exempted from caning due to his age. If imprisonment in lieu of caning was not imposed, then the general deterrent effect would be lost on exempted offenders like the accused. This was particularly given the fact that mandatory minimum imprisonment sentence of five years was already being imposed for his trafficking charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Finally, in calibrating the appropriate duration of the custodial sentence in lieu of caning to impose, I considered the mitigating factors cited by the Defence, including the accused’s medical condition. Prisons further confirmed with this court that it was equipped with the necessary medical facilities to manage the accused’s medical condition.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     All things considered, I was of the view that the additional sentence of <u>10 weeks’ imprisonment</u> in lieu of the mandatory minimum of five strokes of the cane was proportional to the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as
