assaulted a man who intervened in a quarrel which did not concern him. As a result of the assault, the man, Lim Leong Tat (“the Deceased”) succumbed to his injuries, and passed away soon after the attack. The three men were subsequently charged in court:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_i"></a>(i)     Mollah Hasan, a 34-year-old Bangladeshi national, was charged under section 325 read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”) for causing grievous hurt to the Deceased, in furtherance of his common intention with Rana Sohel;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Rana Sohel, a 38-year-old Bangladeshi national, was charged under section 325 read with section 34 of the Penal Code for causing grievous hurt to the Deceased, in furtherance of his common intention with Mollah Hasan; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Reza Md Hasan (“Reza Hasan”), a 32-year-old Bangladeshi national, was charged under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code for causing hurt to the Deceased, in furtherance of his common intention with Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Mollah Hasan, Rana Sohel and Reza Hasan (referred to collectively as “the accused persons”) were represented by the same counsel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 16 December 2020, I convicted the three accused persons of their respective charges. After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation and address on sentence presented by the Defence, I sentenced the accused persons as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_i"></a>(i)     Mollah Hasan – four years’ imprisonment, with effect from 24 August 2018 (with the Singapore Prison Service taking into account the period that he was out on bail), and six strokes of the cane;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Rana Sohel – four years’ imprisonment, with effect from 21 July 2017 (with the Singapore Prison Service taking into account the period that he was out on bail), and six strokes of the cane; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Reza Hasan – six months’ imprisonment, with effect from 28 September 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Mollah Hasan has filed an appeal against sentence, while Rana Sohel has filed an appeal against both conviction and sentence. Rana Sohel is currently on bail pending appeal. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       To prove its case, the Prosecution adduced evidence from three main witnesses:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_i"></a>(i)     Tan Wei Li (“Tan”) (PW7);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Hossen Mohamad Sanowar (“Sanowar”) (PW6); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the forensic pathologist, Dr George Paul (“Dr George”) (PW9).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In addition, the Prosecution called six other witnesses, and adduced the conditioned statements of seven formal witnesses<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and a video footage (P9) of the assault. The video footage was stitched together by SSI Ng Shao Jiuan (“SSI Ng”) (PW4) in chronological order, from the various CCTV video clips which were obtained.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The authenticity of the video footage was not disputed, and it was also not disputed that the cause of the Deceased’s death on 9 July 2017, which was the day of the attack, was severe neck injury as reflected in the Autopsy Report (P16).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Further, it was not disputed that the confrontation between the Deceased and the accused persons started at the Tasvee Restaurant along Geylang Road. At that time, Sanowar was with the accused persons. Lastly, it was not disputed that the Deceased was not known to Tan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and the accused persons. Neither were the accused persons or Sanowar<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> known to Tan.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of Tan Wei Li</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Tan testified that on the day in question, he was at Tasvee Restaurant with his friends when he noticed the accused persons and Sanowar shouting at his friends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. At that time, the accused persons and Sanowar were seated at a table within Tasvee Restaurant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Tan then approached their table and confronted them. While Tan and the accused persons were sorting out their differences (Sanowar was not involved<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>), the Deceased suddenly appeared and interrupted their conversation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. According to Tan, a fight then broke out between the Deceased and the accused persons<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. However, Tan was unable to recall who threw the first punch<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Tan further testified that the accused persons then assaulted the Deceased, while Sanowar tried to stop the fight<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.

Eventually, after assaulting the Deceased, the accused persons and Sanowar left the scene. Tan approached the Deceased and asked if he needed to go to the hospital.

He then bent down, squatted, and stood up. He started walking before squatting down again. He got up and walked a few meters before putting his hand against the wall, squatted, sat down and leaned against the wall before slumping to the ground. After the attack, and after the Deceased walked away from the scene, he was alone until his body was spotted by Larsen.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The accused persons were subsequently placed under arrest.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defence’s Case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a <em>prima facie</em> case against the accused persons and called upon them to give evidence in their defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The accused persons elected to give evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Reza Hasan denied assaulting the Deceased. He claimed that he was merely trying to stop the Deceased from fighting. Rana Sohel claimed that he only punched the Deceased on his back and at the top of his head. Mollah Hasan claimed that he tried to kick the Deceased but missed, and denied pushing the Deceased onto the concrete steps.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In addition, Mollah Hasan and Reza Hasan claimed that Sanowar had assaulted the Deceased.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Closing Submissions</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s submissions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Prosecution approached its case in two stages.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The first stage being events which happened immediately after the Deceased punched Rana Sohel.

Tan was not known to the accused persons, the Deceased and Sanowar, and the Defence did not offer any reason for Tan to lie or fabricate evidence against the accused persons. Likewise, Sanowar had no reason to lie – the accused persons were his friends, while the Deceased was unknown to him. There was therefore no reason for him to falsely implicate the accused persons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The accounts of Tan and Sanowar were supported by objective video evidence which authenticity was not challenged by the Defence, nor was it alleged by the Defence that SSI Ng had missed out footage which was relevant to the present case. Tan’s and Sanowar’s accounts of the assault, and the video footage corroborated Dr George’s expert opinion that the Deceased’s death was due to a severe neck injury:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_i"></a>(i)     I accepted Tan’s and Sanowar’s evidence that Reza Hasan had grabbed or slapped the Deceased’s arm before pushing him towards the road. This was captured at time-stamps 23:41 to 23:45 of the video. Tan’s evidence was that Reza Hasan had grabbed the Deceased by the arm and was trying to hurt him. The Deceased was seen struggling. As for Sanowar, his evidence was that he heard a slapping sound when Reza Hasan hit the Deceased’s arm, and the Deceased had exclaimed “Ah”. This happened soon after Reza Hasan and Mollah Hasan were seen wagging their fingers at the Deceased and moving towards him in an aggressive manner.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     I accepted the evidence of Tan and Sanowar that the Deceased, other than punching Rana Sohel at the beginning, did not hit any of the other accused persons before he was assaulted by Reza Hasan.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     I further accepted the evidence of Tan that the Deceased and the accused persons then moved towards the five-foot way in the direction of the KTV lounge. Tan saw Rana Sohel grab the Deceased by his hair and hit him, while Sanowar saw Rana Sohel punch the Deceased on his neck. They then witnessed the Deceased’s falling on the five-foot way and Mollah Hasan kicking him. Tan testified that the kick landed on the Deceased’s head while Sanowar said that although the kick landed on the Deceased, he was unsure which part of the Deceased’s body was kicked. That the Deceased did not attack the accused persons was apparent from Tan’s evidence – Tan testified that he had picked up a metal rack to stop Rana Sohel and Mollah Hasan from further assaulting the Deceased.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Finally, I accepted the evidence of Tan that Rana Sohel came and punched the Deceased’s head, while the Deceased was lying near the steps, before the accused persons ran off.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I found Sanowar to be an honest witness who did not embellish his testimony in court. For example, Sanowar readily admitted that he did not see where, on the Deceased’s body, Mollah Hasan’s kick had landed. Likewise, Tan did not downplay his role and readily admitted that he had exchanged vulgarities with Rana Sohel at the start, as he had mistakenly thought that Rana Sohel was scolding his friends. He also did not embellish his evidence and admitted that he was unsure who had started the fight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As for whether Reza Hasan had caused bodily pain to the deceased, it could be inferred from the Deceased’s reaction to Reza Hasan’s action that some form of bodily pain was caused. Sanowar had testified that he could hear a slapping sound when Reza Hasan’s hand came into contact with the Deceased, and the Deceased had said “Ah”. Tan also testified that the Deceased reacted to Reza Hasan’s action by struggling.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The portions of the stitched video showing the assault</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I found that the video corroborated the evidence of Tan and Sanowar that the accused persons had assaulted the Deceased, thus satisfying the criminal act element as enunciated in <em>Daniel Vijay</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It was clear from the video from time-stamps 23:36 to 23:45 that the accused persons were moving towards the Deceased in a menacing manner, and Reza Hasan and Mollah Hasan were wagging their fingers aggressively at the Deceased. This happened just before Reza Hasan hit and grabbed the Deceased’s arm, and then pushed him towards the direction of the road. It was clear from the video that Reza Hasan’s action was a deliberate attack, and not an action which was accidental or borne out of self-defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Between time-stamps 25:52 and 26:10, Rana Sohel could be seen grabbing the Deceased’s hair and punching him on the back of the head near the neck. Thereafter, the Deceased fell to the ground. While the Deceased was still on the ground, Mollah Hasan came from behind and gave a kick to the Deceased’s head, which resulted in the Deceased’s head jerking to his right. Likewise, the actions of Rana Sohel and Mollah Hasan were deliberate and not borne out of self-defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     At time-stamp 28:20, Reza Hasan appeared on the screen, followed by Mollah Hasan slamming the Deceased against the roller shutter at time-stamp 28:24. The Deceased was then pushed onto the concrete steps at time-stamp 28:28, and was at an awkward angle, with his neck twisted to his left. While the Deceased was still lying on the concrete steps, Rana Sohel came from behind and pressed the Deceased’s face down with his left hand before punching the Deceased at least twice on the head, near the neck.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dr George’s evidence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It was clear from Dr George’s evidence that the Deceased died of a severe neck injury. Dr George explained that in order to cause a subluxation of the atlanto-occipital joint, the ligaments and muscles around the joint would first have to be “softened”. He opined that it was unlikely that a single force had caused the severe neck injury in view of the absence of any obvious external injury nor would falling, on the part of the Deceased, result in the kind of injuries he found on the Deceased.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Dr George further opined that a cumulation of blunt trauma to the back of the Deceased’s neck would likely have caused the injuries found by him. In addition, it was Dr George’s opinion that the action of slamming the Deceased on the roller shutter followed by a hard push onto the concrete steps with the Deceased’s neck twisted to the left would have contributed to the loosening of the ligaments and muscles around his neck.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the accused persons had acted in furtherance of their common intention to cause hurt and/or grievous hurt to the Deceased</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Having determined that the accused persons had satisfied the “criminal act element” by assaulting the Deceased, as seen from the video and according to the evidence of Tan and Sanowar, I next considered if the accused persons had acted with common intention to cause hurt and/or grievous hurt to the Deceased.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It is clear from <em>Daniel Vijay</em> at [97] that whether there was common intention between the offenders could be inferred from their conduct and the surrounding circumstances. It is also trite that common intention amongst the offenders can be developed on the spot (see <em>Asogan Ramesh</em> at [34]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The video showed the Deceased punching Rana Sohel at time-stamp 23:29. The accused persons reacted adversely to it and started advancing towards the Deceased who retreated to the foreground of the video. In fact, the Defence had described Mollah Hasan and Rezan Hasan to be “charging towards” the Deceased<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> and “the manner like want to go and attack him [sic]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. Mollah Hasan and Reza Hasan were wagging their fingers before Reza Hasan slapped and grabbed the Deceased’s arm, and pushed him towards the road. Rana Sohel could be seen just behind them at that juncture. It could therefore be inferred by the conduct of the accused persons that there was a common intention between them to cause hurt to the Deceased for punching Rana Sohel, moments before the accused persons acts of aggression.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     After the Deceased was assaulted by Reza Hasan, the accused persons could be seen pursuing the Deceased who then retreated to the background of the video. It was the evidence of Tan and Sanowar that all three accused persons followed the Deceased to the five-foot way. At some point, Rana Sohel grabbed the Deceased by his hair and punched the nape of the Deceased’s neck. Reza Hasan could be seen walking parallel to them and looking on at time-stamp 26:05 as the Deceased was being assaulted by Rana Sohel. This was followed by Mollah Hasan who gave the Deceased a hard kick on the head.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Deceased was further assaulted by Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, with Reza Hasan hovering around during the further assaults by Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Having viewed the video, and considered the conduct of the accused persons and the surrounding circumstances, it was clear to me that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel had acted with common intention when they relentlessly pursued the Deceased and took turns to attack him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     By attacking a vulnerable part of the Deceased’s body repeatedly, which was his neck or his head near the neck, Rana Sohel and Mollah Hasan must have the knowledge that some form of grievous hurt would be caused, or intended for some form of grievous hurt to be caused:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In the present case, as explained above, the appellant’s blow was of such a significant force, that in my judgment, it displayed, at the very least, the appellant’s clear knowledge that he was likely to cause grievous hurt, and, having as a matter of fact caused grievous hurt, he was thus guilty of an offence punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>per</em> Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21768-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGHC 116</a> at [47])</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I disbelieved the allegations of the accused persons that Sanowar had contributed to the Deceased’s injuries by hitting him. This was flatly denied by Sanowar, and corroborated by Tan’s evidence that Sanowar did not partake in the assault of the Deceased. I will deal more with the credibility of the accused persons below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I next considered the presence of the “participation element” in relation to the accused persons <em>i.e.</em>, the formation of the unity of criminal behaviour from their individual acts. While Reza Hasan did not assault the Deceased beyond hitting the Deceased on his arm and pushing him towards the road, Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel continued to assault the Deceased after he was pushed onto the road by Reza Hasan. Their participation was clear from the video footage, and the evidence of Tan and Sanowar, which showed a “unity of criminal behaviour” on the part of Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, resulting in grievous hurt being caused to the Deceased.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Credibility of the accused persons</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Having found that the Prosecution has proved its case against the accused persons, I considered whether the Defence had raised a reasonable doubt.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In determining the credibility of the accused persons, I took into account the consistency of their evidence and their demeanour in court. As pointed out by the Prosecution, their evidence was externally and internally inconsistent and they were evasive in court. The following are some examples:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_i"></a>(i)     Reza Hasan claimed that when he and Mollah Hasan charged towards the Deceased, they had intended to tell him not to fight as the Deceased was “taking position to fight again”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Reza Hasan then grabbed the Deceased’s arm and told him to move<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>. However, under cross-examination, Reza Hasan claimed that he did not grab or push the Deceased. When he finally conceded that he was in an angry mood, he claimed that it was because he was hungry and did not sleep the night before<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Reza Hasan’s evidence that he had not intentionally slapped the Deceased’s arm was contradicted by the evidence of Tan and Sanowar. In any event, it was not apparent from the video footage the Deceased was “taking a position to fight” when Reza Hasan and Mollah Hasan approached him.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Reza Hasan claimed in examination-in-chief that the Deceased had punched Rana Sohel five to six times<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, while in cross-examination, he claimed that the Deceased had punched Rana Sohel two to four times<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>. However, Rana Sohel himself said that the Deceased had only punched him once<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     When Reza Hasan was questioned why he had wagged his finger at the Deceased, Reza Hasan gave an illogical reply – that he had intended to raise five fingers, but because he did not sleep the whole night and had not had breakfast, he ended up raising just one finger<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Reza Hasan tried to distance himself from the scene when he claimed that he left the scene midway through the altercation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. However, he could clearly be seen in the video, and his evidence that he left halfway was contradicted by the evidence of Tan and Sanowar.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_v"></a>(v)     Rana Sohel claimed that he only punched the Deceased’s back and head. However, this was contradicted by the video evidence showing that Rana Sohel had punched the Deceased’s nape and head. In addition, Tan saw Rana Sohel hitting the Deceased on the neck. Tan was an independent eye-witness who neither knew the Deceased or the accused persons at the time of the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     Rana Sohel claimed that the Deceased’s severe neck injury could have been due to the Deceased’s fall on the concrete steps. His claim was directly contradicted by the expert evidence of Dr George.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_vii"></a>(vii)     Mollah Hasan claimed that although he tried to kick the Deceased, he had missed and his foot did not come into contact with the Deceased. This contradicted the Defence’s position when IO Lim Leong Chee was being cross-examined – that Mollah Hasan had either <em>stepped or stamped</em> on the Deceased’s head<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>, and not that Mollah Hasan had <em>kicked</em> the Deceased. His assertion was also contradicted by the video footage that his kick landed on the Deceased, which caused the Deceased’s head, as could be seen on the video footage, jerking to the side.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_viii"></a>(viii)    Mollah Hasan claimed that he did not throw the Deceased against the roller shutter or slam the Deceased onto the concrete steps – this was contradicted by the video footage, which showed clearly that Mollah Hasan had thrown the Deceased against the roller shutter before slamming him onto the concrete steps. Mollah Hasan’s inexplicable assertion that the Deceased had punched him a few times at that juncture and had fallen on his own, thereby dragging Mollah Hasan along<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> was not supported by the video footage, which was objective evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_ix"></a>(ix)     Mollah Hasan asserted that the Deceased had hit his head against the bollard and passed away as a result<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>. This was neither put to Dr George nor borne out by the video footage.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_x"></a>(x)     Reza Hasan and Mollah Hasan claimed that Sanowar had assaulted the Deceased. However, this was directly contradicted by the evidence of Tan, and Rana Sohel testified that he was not aware that Sanowar had assaulted the Deceased<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence of provocation </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In its Closing Submission, the Defence raised the defence of provocation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>. In my view, neither Tan’s or the Deceased’s actions constituted grave and sudden provocation. The episode between Tan and the accused persons had clearly blown over by the time the Deceased punched Rana Sohel. They turned towards the Deceased and went after him relentlessly – the Deceased was clearly outnumbered by them and was no match for them. Even if the Deceased’s punch had provoked them, it was insufficient to amount to grave and sudden provocation and certainly not to the extent of causing them to be deprived of their self-control to cause them to attack the Deceased so viciously. The attack by Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel was totally disproportionate to the single punch that the Deceased gave to Rana Sohel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The accused persons claimed that the Deceased had challenged them to a fight and/or had punched them along the five-foot way during the portion of the video that neither the accused persons were, nor the Deceased was visible in the video. Likewise, even if this was true (which I rejected), I did not think that it was sufficient to amount to grave and sudden provocation. In any event, I disbelieved that the Deceased had assaulted the accused persons along the five-foot way as I accepted the evidence of Tan and Sanowar that the Deceased did not assault the accused persons beyond the first punch that he threw at Rana Sohel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case, beyond a reasonable doubt, against the accused persons. In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that an adverse inference be drawn against Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, under section 169 of the CPC for failing to mention their Case for the Defence that Sanowar had also attacked the Deceased. However, I found the evidence against them overwhelming, and there was no necessity for me to draw an adverse inference against them, under section 169 of the CPC, in order to convict them.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Sentence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     An offence under section 325 of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years.

The Prosecution submitted that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel had repeatedly assaulted the Deceased in the neck region and had kicked him in the head. This was even though the Deceased was trying to disengage from them. Based on <em>BDB</em>, the starting point would be a term of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>. In its submissions, the Prosecution highlighted four aggravating factors: (i) the assault on the Deceased was brutal and sustained; (ii) it was a group assault; (iii) the assault caused public disquiet; and (iv) the offence was committed while Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel were on bail for other offences<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     However, the Prosecution recognised that there was “no clear evidence” that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel “had intended or anticipated that death would ensue” from their attack. Taking reference from the case of <em>Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22536-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 449</a> (“<em>Muhammad Khalis</em>”), the Prosecution submitted that the sentence in the present case should not be less than the sentence imposed on the offender in <em>Muhammad Khalis</em>. In <em>Muhammad Khalis</em>, the deceased had died after hitting his head on a road kerb as a result of a single blow to his jaw by the offender.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Mitigation Plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In its Mitigation Plea, the Defence submitted, for a sentence of “at least three years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The Defence submitted that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel were remorseful and they “sincerely apologised” to the Deceased’s family<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>. They did not plan the assault, and no weapon was used. In addition, it submitted that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel did not start the fight and that it could not be ruled out that “the Deceased and Tan [were] completely blameless”. Both of them did not envisage that their assault would “end with the death” of the Deceased<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In relation to Mollah Hasan, the Defence further highlighted that his parents were in Bangladesh and were ill – they just wanted Mollah Hasan to return to them as soon as possible<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>. With respect to Rana Sohel, the Defence highlighted that he was the sole bread winner of his family, and he has a five-year-old son who required dialysis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I took guidance from the case of <em>BDB</em> and applied a two-step process in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In the present case, the injuries caused were serious, and the consequences were fatal. According to the case of <em>BDB</em>, the starting point in a case where death is caused “should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> and 12 strokes of the cane<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Having identified the starting point for this case, I next considered the culpability of Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel. The facts of the present case bore some similarities to the facts in <em>Muhammad Khalis</em>. In that case, the offender pleaded guilty to two rioting charges and a drug consumption charge. However, he claimed trial to a charge under section 325 of the Penal Code (“the section 325 charge”). He was convicted of the section 325 charge and sentenced to a term of seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The offender was involved in two rioting incidents immediately before the incident involving the section 325 charge. The deceased was not involved in the rioting incidents although he was present at the scene and had observed the two incidents. After the two rioting incidents, the offender became involved in a third dispute, involving the offender’s friend and the deceased’s friend. When the deceased tried to intervene, the offender came from behind and gave the deceased a lunging punch. The punch landed on the deceased’s jaw and caused the deceased to fall, landing on is head and shoulder. The deceased was unable to take any evasive action or break his fall as the punch had knocked him unconscious. On appeal, his sentence was reduced to four and a half years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that there were aggravating factors. First, both Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel committed the present offences while on bail. Second, the assault was sustained and they had pursued the Deceased even as he tried to disengage. Third, the Deceased was outnumbered by them. Finally, the incident was committed in the morning, in full view of members of public, thereby causing public disquiet.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I next considered the factors raised by the Defence in mitigation. In the present case, Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel had claimed trial. While it was their right to claim trial to the charges, it would mean that they were not entitled to any discount in the sentence, unlike in the case of a first-time offender pleading guilty to his charge in a timeous manner. Contrary to their Mitigation Plea, I did not find them to be remorseful. They did not take the trial seriously – they were talking amongst themselves in the dock and snickering, and had to be told off<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span>. Their antics only stopped after they were told to sit at a distance from each other.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In relation to their family circumstances, it is well established that other than in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances, personal or financial hardships carries little mitigating value and “may not be relied on during mitigation” (<em>Ong Ker Seng v PP</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 406 at [30] and <em>PP v Tan Fook Sum</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022.xml')">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022</a> at [31]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     However, I was of the view that the culpability of Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel was not as high as the offender’s culpability in <em>Muhammad Khalis</em>. The offender in <em>Muhammad Khalis</em> had a chequered past and the attack against the deceased in that case was completely unprovoked. The offender was also involved in two other rioting incidents which culminated into the offence leading to the death of the deceased.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Having the above in mind, I was of the view that a sentence which was slightly less than that meted out on the offender in <em>Muhammad Khalis</em> was fair, and I therefore imposed a sentence of four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel. As Mollah Hasan was in remand at the time of sentence, I ordered his sentence to be backdated to his date of remand, and gave directions for the Singapore Prison Service to take into account the period that Mollah Hasan was on bail. Rana Sohel was also in remand before he was bailed out, and his sentence was likewise backdated to his date of remand, with the Singapore Prison Service to take into account the period that Rana Sohel was released on bail.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     For completeness, Reza Hasan was sentenced to a term of six months’ imprisonment for his role in this incident. Unlike Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, he was charged for a lesser offence under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Having given careful consideration to the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel. In my view, a sentence of four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of cane would adequately reflect the culpability of Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, and would give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>These were enforcement officers who retrieved the video footage from
