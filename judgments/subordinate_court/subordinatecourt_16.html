Yuen stayed in another location, but used the rental car to fetch the accused, Xiutong, and Xiuji to various locations around Singapore in between 21 July 2019 to 28 July 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    Sometime before 24 July 2019, pursuant to the said Plan, the accused persons targeted units in The Floridian and The Archipelago condominiums.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    The first report of housebreaking at The Floridian, 975 Bukit Timah Road, #XXX, Singapore, was lodged on 24 July 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    Subsequently, numerous police reports were filed for incidents of housebreaking that took place at The Archipelago on 26 and 27 July 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    Pursuant to their Plan, the accused persons left Singapore on 28 July 2019. Yuen returned the rental car at Changi Airport at about 2.15pm, took a taxi to Woodlands Checkpoint, and thereafter left Singapore at about 5.50pm via Woodlands Checkpoint. Separately, the accused, Xiutong, and Xiuji departed from Singapore through Changi Airport at about 7.37pm on the same flight.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    On 7 November 2019, the accused re-entered Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint at about 1.48pm. He was not accompanied by any of the three co-accused persons. He was arrested by the police on 10 November 2019, at about 9.30am, at JoyFor Backpackers Hostel, located at 135 Geylang Road. The accused was arrested as a result of extensive police investigations.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>MANNER OF ENTRY INTO THE ARCHIPELAGO (1<sup>st</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> CHARGES)</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    Investigations revealed that two of the accused persons (“the burglars”) entered into The Archipelago compound on 26 and 27 July 2019 to commit housebreaking by night in order to commit theft. The manner in which they entered into The Archipelago compound was as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a)    Yuen would drive his rental car and pick the accused, Xiutong, and Xiuji from the Serangoon flat at about 7.00pm. On both nights, the accused and Xiuji were dressed in light-coloured t-shirts and dark-coloured shorts. Xiutong wore a black t-shirt and jeans, while Yuen wore a yellow t-shirt and white shorts.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)    On both nights, Yuen drove the car towards The Archipelago and entered a public carpark near to The Archipelago at about 7.30pm.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c)    The burglars, clad in light coloured t-shirts and dark-coloured shorts, would leave the car and walk across the road to Bedok Reservoir Park. They would walk along a paved route in the Park, which led them to the back gate of The Archipelago.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">d)    The burglars would walk past the back gate of The Archipelago and subsequently cut across an open grass patch and walk towards the fencing of The Archipelago compound. This was to conduct surveillance and assess the appropriate time to break in.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">e)    Upon reaching the fencing (the “entry point”), the burglars would change their attire into a dark-coloured shirt and dark-coloured pants. The area around the entry point was surrounded with plants and trees and was not well-lit. This was part of their plan to avoid detection while they moved within the condominium compound.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">f)    They then climbed over The Archipelago fencing and dropped down into the condominium compound.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    After committing the offences of housebreaking, the burglars would leave The Archipelago compound by climbing back across the fencing at the entry point or another part of the fencing. They would then change back into their light coloured t-shirts and darkcoloured shorts. They would walk back to the paved route in Bedok Reservoir Park, and head back to the public carpark. They would then board the rental car and Yuen would drive the four accused persons back to the Serangoon flat.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1<sup>st</sup> CHARGE (DAC-931599-2019)</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    The first victim is Hiew Wai Sun, Male, 49 years.

highlighted that the mandatory minimum imprisonment term of two years for offences under s 457 of the Penal Code where the purpose of house-breaking by night was to commit theft signals the need for deterrent sentences to discourage such offences. The prosecution urged the court to impose the benchmark sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment for each of the proceeded charges, in accordance with the benchmark laid down by the High Court in <em>PP v Shamsul bin Sa’at</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 3 SLR 0900.xml')">[2010] 3 SLR 900</a> (“<em>Shamsul bin Sa’at</em>”) at [26]. The prosecution also highlighted that while the courts have on occasion adjusted sentences below the benchmark on account of an offender’s plea of guilty, the benchmark in <em>Shamsul bin Sa’at</em> applies to offenders who have pleaded guilty.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The prosecution’s position is that all aggravating and mitigating factors should be considered at the second stage of the analysis, in determining the number of imprisonment terms that ought to run consecutively, and arriving at the aggregate sentence. This submission appeared to have been made with the objective of reducing the risk of double counting any aggravating and mitigating factors at the first and second stages of the analysis. In relation to the aggregate sentence, the prosecution’s position is that all three imprisonment terms should be ordered to run consecutively.

The factors which would determine the scale of severity are: <em>the method of entry</em> (for example, putting a hand through a window which the offender has opened to take a radio is a far cry from forcible entry); the <em>degree of sophisticated planning and organisation engaged in</em>; whether the offender was part of a group; the time of the break-in (night as opposed to day time); the <em>type of premises</em> (residential as opposed to nonresidential); whether the offence was accompanied by acts of wanton vandalism, force or violence; whether the occupier was present; the effect on the occupier; whether the offence was directed at an elderly, disabled or sick victim; the value of the property taken; the number of offences committed; and the <em>antecedents of the offender</em>…While no distinction is drawn between the punishment prescribed for housebreaking committed in a dwelling house and those in commercial and industrial premises, the sentencing purposes, <em>housebreaking of dwelling houses</em> is viewed more seriously than housebreaking of commercial and industrial premises…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the summary of cases shows, most offenders usually face multiple charges of housebreaking.

These indicators included: that the accused had committed a series of similar offences, there was premeditation and careful planning, there were “professional hallmarks” due to the manner of entry and the fact that no finger prints or DNA were left behind, there was forced entry, ransacking and damage, high value of property stolen, and that it was a group offence with transnational elements. In its oral submissions, the prosecution also highlighted that there is a pressing public interest to deter similar offences, given that there is a foreign syndicate involved, and that the accused had entered Singapore for the purpose of committing the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In particular, the prosecution urged the court to consider the following factors as relevant in relation to the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The offences were committed with a high degree of planning and sophistication. The accused and three co-conspirators had planned their routes of entry into the condominiums and were equipped with tools to break in and force open locked doors and drawers. Dark-coloured clothing changes were planned so as to mininmise the risk of detection during the commission of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     The loss from the spate of break-ins over a span of four days was $118,375.83. The accused and co-conspirators planned a series of break-ins into multiple units and in two different condominiums over the course of four days before departing from Singapore with the loot very soon after.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Damage had been caused in the course of house-breaking to a number of units.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     The accused returned to Singapore in November 2019, emboldened by his experience in July 2019, in order to commit further house-breaking offences. The 8<sup>th</sup> Charge concerned the very same residential unit as that in DAC-905360-2020, which the accused had previously engaged in a conspiracy with the co-conspirators to break into. On that basis, specific deterrence is warranted.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The prosecution submitted that a global sentence of 90 months’ imprisonment would be in line with the most analogous precedent of <em>PP v Chen Jianhua</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/60142-M.xml')">[2008] SGDC 383</a> (“<em>Chen Jianhua</em>”), where the offender had employed similar <em>modus operandi</em> in breaking into a number of residential units to commit theft. In <em>Chen Jianhua</em>, the accused pleaded guilty to 10 counts of house-breaking by night with theft and was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment for each count, which involved loss to victims totalling $36,295.50, an amount far lower than the total loss caused in the instant case, which was $118,375.83. Three of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively, giving rise to a global sentence of 90 months’ imprisonment in <em>Chen Jianhua</em>. The offender’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court. The prosecution submitted that in <em>Chen Jianhua</em>, the accused’s <em>modus operandi</em> was most analagous to the instant case, which involved climbing over the walls or fences of the condominium compound and scouring the compound for suitable units to break into. The offender entered by sliding open balcony doors or pushing open windows. The prosecution submitted that the accused’s culpability was higher than the offender in <em>Chen Jianhua</em>, because there was no indication of damage caused to units as result of offending, and the offender had acted alone. In the instant case, the accused had acted with his co-conspirators in a group in July 2019, which merited greater consideration of the need for deterrence in sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The prosecution submitted that running three imprisonment terms consecutively would be in line with <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a> (“<em>Shouffee</em>”) at [30] as the offences represented an invasion of different protected legal interests, that is to say, the interests of different victims. While the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and 5<sup>th</sup> Charge were committed approximately one day apart, the 8<sup>th</sup> Charge concerned a completely different occasion of offending, as the accused had taken the effort to re-enter Singapore in November 2019 in order to commit further offences. Ordering the three imprisonment terms to run consecutively will also be commensurate with the accused’s overall criminality in view of the higher amount of loss caused as opposed to the case of <em>Chen Jianhua</em>, participation in a group offence and return to Singapore in order to commit further offences of a similar nature<em>.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Counsel for the accused accepted that the benchmark sentence for house-breaking by night to commit theft under s 457 of the Penal Code is in the region of 30 months’ imprisonment. Counsel did not take issue with the prosecution’s submission that each of the offences should attract the individual sentences of about 30 months’ imprisonment. Counsel for the accused did not take issue with the prosecution’s characterisation of the accused’s offending as premeditated, and concerned group offences by foreign nationals targeting Singapore. Counsel submitted that the accused’s share of the loot was small, though the amount of benefit obtained by the accused was not stated in the mitigation plea. Counsel also urged the court to take into account the accused’s plea of guilty that has saved resources for all concerned.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Counsel’s key argument in the written mitigation plea is to urge the court to consider ordering that only two of the imprisonment terms to run consecutively, and to arrive at an aggregate sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. Counsel urged the court to consider the application of the totality principle as laid down in the cases of <em>Shouffee</em> and <em>PP v Raveen Balakrishnan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22604-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 799</a> (“<em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em>”). Counsel’s submission is that a sentence of 90 months’ imprisonment would be substantially higher than the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences, and would amount to a crushing sentence in the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     To counsel’s credit, he candidly accepted that the accused had returned to Singapore in November 2019 “to try his luck”, and the accused’s actions in this regard formed the basis of the 8<sup>th</sup> Charge and some of the TIC Charges which arose from the accused’s return to Singapore in November 2019. Counsel had fairly accepted an uplift above the mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment was warranted for the 8<sup>th</sup> Charge, and conceded that an individual sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment would not be excessive, given the aggravating factors present in this case. Counsel for the accused also candidly and fairly accepted in oral submissions that applying <em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em>, it would be be permissible to run all three sentences consecutively, though it would be necessary for the court to moderate the aggregate sentence in application of the totality principle, which is a principle of limitation to ensure the proportionality of the overall sentence to the accused’s overall culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Court’s decision on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable principles</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Applying <em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em> at [38], where the court has to determine the appropriate sentence for multiple offending, the first task of the court is the determination of the appropriate individual sentences for each of the charges, in view of the offence and offender specific factors including harm caused and culpability of the accused. Once these have been determined, the next question is how the individual sentences should be ordered to run so as to derive a suitable aggregate sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The offences were committed in 2019, prior to the repeal of section 457 of the Penal Code which took effect on 1 January 2020. House-breaking by night in order to commit theft under s 457 of the Penal Code is punishable with at least two years’ imprisonment and not more than 14 years’ imprisonment, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine. In respect of the 8<sup>th</sup> Charge, which was for attempted house-breaking by night, the punishment would be a minimum of two years’ imprisonment and not more than seven years’ imprisonment by virtue of s 511(2) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In <em>Shamsul bin Sa’at</em> (see above at [7]) at [26], the High Court cited with approval a District Court’s holding in <em>Chen Jianhua</em>, that the benchmark for cases involving housebreaking and theft of residential property is 30 months’ imprisonment. The following passage from the <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em>, LexisNexis (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2001) at p 502 was cited by the High Court in <em>Shamsul bin Sa’at</em> at [26] with approval:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for housebreaking, the statutory minimum (in some instances) and maximum sentences are a reflection of the extreme seriousness with which Parliament, and hence the courts, will regard the offence of housebreaking. The courts generally apply the principle of deterrence in sentencing in order to discourage such offences. Despite the basic seriousness with which housebreaking is regarded, not all housebreaking can be placed on the same level of seriousness. For an adult offender, the length of custody would be determined by how high or low on the scale of severity the offence falls. <em>The factors which would determine where the offence falls on the scale of severity are: the method of entry (for example, putting a hand through a window which the offender has opened to take a radio is a far cry from forcible entry); the degree of sophisticated planning and organisation engaged in; whether the offender was part of a group; the time of break-in (night as opposed to day time); the type of premises (residential as opposed to non-residential); whether the offence was accompanied by acts of wanton vandalism or by force or violence; whether the occupier was present; the effect on the occupier; whether the offence was directed at the elderly, the disabled and the sick; the value of property taken; the number of offences committed; and the antecedents of the offender … As regards the time of the commission of the offence, the Code prescribes a higher punishment for housebreaking committed at night (between 7pm and before 7am). Whilst no distinction is drawn in the punishment prescribed for housebreaking committed in a dwelling house and those in commercial and industrial premises, for sentencing purposes, however, housebreaking of dwelling houses is viewed more seriously than housebreaking of commercial and industrial premises</em> … [emphasis in original]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     There was no dispute by the defence that the offence-specific factors highlighted by the prosecution (see [9] – [11] above) were correctly identified.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for the individual sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In deciding on the appropriate sentence, I was of the view that the predominant sentencing consideration in this case was general deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The harm caused by the offences was a material consideration in sentencing. I was not able to accept the prosecution’s submission that the extent of loss caused by the offences should be considered only at the second stage of the sentencing exercise, and that the court should impose the identified benchmark of 30 months’ imprisonment for each of the offences regardless of the value of items stolen on each occasion of offending. In my view, it was neither appropriate nor principled to impose an identical benchmark sentence without consideration of whether it is possible for any offence-specific factors to be factored in when imposing the individual sentences for each of the offences, without running the risk of double counting any aggravating or mitigating factors. Furthermore, the punishments prescribed for the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and the 5<sup>th</sup> Charge on the one hand, and the 8<sup>th</sup> Charge on the other, were different. The 8<sup>th</sup> Charge, being a charge for an attempted offence, carried half the maximum punishment (see [19] above).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Consideration of the amount of loss caused as stated in the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and 5<sup>th</sup> Charge in the calibration of the individual sentences for these offences would not inevitably lead to double counting when the court then considers at the second stage of sentencing the <em>total</em> loss caused by the accused’s offences. There would not be double counting of the loss caused to the disparate victims if the court considers at the second stage of the <em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em> inquiry, the <em>additional</em> loss caused to other victims by the commission of the TIC Charges as indicative of the accused’s overall criminality.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I was also concerned to ensure that the premeditation and careful planning detailed in the Statement of Facts should not be counted twice over. Given that the premediation and careful planning with the accused’s co-conspirators extended to the execution of the various break-ins to commit theft in July 2019 in quick succession, it would be preferable to factor in the degree of premeditation at the second stage of the analysis when considering the <em>aggregate</em> sentence. It was essential to have regard to the <em>overall scale</em> of the planning and premeditation as that was indicative of the accused’s overall culpability. Doing so would enable the court to attribute appropriate weight to the accused’s overall culpability for engaging in the “plan” to break into a number of units within two condominiums in succession during a short time frame, avoiding detection, and to remove the loot from Singapore to avoid detection. For the same reasons, the prosecution’s submission that the accused and the co-conspirators had acted in a syndicate and that the offences committed had transnational elements should also be considered in the second stage of analysis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I turn now to address the prosecution’s submission that the forcible entry into the units, as well as ransacking and damage concerned in some of the units indicated the seriousness of the offences committed. The prosecution also submitted that there was ransacking and damage in the units in the prosecution’s address on sentence at [15]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Unit in DAC-905360-2020 (TIC-ed): Balcony table was found broken. Photographs were strewn on the floor. Drawers were found open and ransacked.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Unit in DAC-932249-2019 (TIC-ed): Mosquito net at toilet window was removed. Previously locked jewellery drawer in bedroom was forced open and ransacked.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Unit in DAC-932550-2019 (Proceeded): Locked drawers in the clothes wardrobe was pried open and ransacked.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As far as DAC-905360-2020 and DAC-932249-2019 were concerned, the Statement of Facts did not provide the factual basis from which the court may conclude that the commission of those offences involved any damage or ransacking. The prosecution’s submissions on sentence are dependent and circumscribed by the Statement of Facts to which the accused had the opportunity to either agree to or dispute (see <em>Ng Jun Xian v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20374-SSP.xml')">[2017] 3 SLR 933</a> at [48]). While the prosecution may invite the court to draw suitable and reasonable inferences from the facts which have been set out in the statement of facts, reliance on facts stated in the prosecution’s sentencing address which were not included in the statement of facts should generally not be allowed. Two of the stated ransacked areas pertain to TIC Charges, and the fact of ransacking of these two units was not stated in the Statement of Facts or in the TIC Charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, it was permissible to take into account that in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and 5<sup>th</sup> Charge, there was forcible entry. In the case of the 8<sup>th</sup> Charge, there was an attempt made to pry open the sliding door, and it was through the vigilance of the victim in securing the door that the accused had failed to break in. With respect to the damage caused, while the Statement of Facts pertaining to the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and the 5<sup>th</sup> Charge indicated that the manner of breaking in involved forcing open sliding doors, and that drawers were pried open in the commission of the offence in the 5<sup>th</sup> Charge, the extent of damage to the properties occasioned was not specifically stated or quantified. Thus, the damage to the property was not a weighty offence-specific factor in the instant case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Having regard to the high value of items stolen from victims concerning the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and the 5<sup>th</sup> Charge, I was of the view that an uplift above the 30 months’ imprisonment benchmark (for first time offenders who have pleaded guilty) was warranted for both the charges. In respect of the 5<sup>th</sup> Charge, an uplift of six months’ imprisonment above the 30 months’ imprisonment benchmark was warranted, resulting in the individual sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment. This is in view of the high value of items stolen (far in excess compared with the amount of loss caused in any individual offence committed in the precedents cited). Furthermore, the manner of breaking into the unit involved some degree of damage, including the prying open of drawers and the balcony door. In respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge, I was of the view that a two months’ uplift was warranted given that the value of items was high, albeit lower than that concerned in the 5<sup>th</sup> Charge, thus I arrived at the individual sentence of 32 months’ imprisonment. I considered relevant to sentencing that the items stolen were not recovered and that no restitution had been made.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In respect of the 8<sup>th</sup> Charge, I was of the view that an uplift above the two years’ mandatory minimum imprisonment was warranted. In my view, an individual sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment, which falls below the benchmark sentence for housebreaking to commit theft under s 457 of the Penal Code was appropriate. The individual sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment was arrived at with due consideration that the maximum punishment for an offence under s 457 read with s 511 of the Penal Code was halved, <em>ie</em>, 7 years’ imprisonment. The modest uplift was warranted in view of the damage to the balcony door lever caused and dent marks at the balcony door, and careful steps taken to enter the compound on that particular occasion detailed at [27] of the Statement of Facts.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for the aggregate sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It is a general rule that where two or more offences form part of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of those offences should in general run concurrently, and the question of whether the various offences form part of a single transaction turns on whether they entail a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest”: <em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em> at [39]. In determining this, proximities in time, place, continuity of action, and continuity in purpose or design have utility. Where offences are unrelated, each offence committed should generally attract its own distinct consequence. It is apposite to note the guidance provided by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in <em>Shouffee</em> at [42] in this regard:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The enquiry into whether there is an invasion of the same underlying interest looks at things from the perspective of the victim. But there is another way of approaching the ultimate question of how the offender should be punished and that is to view it from the perspective of the accused. <em>On this premise, the imposition of consecutive sentences would be appropriate if the second (or other subsequent) offence reflects increased culpability on the accused’s part even where, as a technical matter, the multiple offences might form part of the same transaction.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the present case, the accused person and his co-conspirators had set out to commit house-breaking against multiple residential units in July 2019, constituting targeted violations of the legally protected interests of multiple victims residing in various different units. The accused and the co-conspirators had made detailed plans, from the rental of a vehicle, to planning the route of entry and escaping from the condominiums targeted, for break-ins to commit theft of jewellery, cash and other valuable items. Treating the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and 5<sup>th</sup> Charge as offences as being committed in one transaction meriting concurrent sentences would result in the accused being punished less harshly simply because the multiple offences were committed in quick succession due to detailed planning and coordination.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The High Court has eludicated in <em>Seng Foo Building Construction Pte Ltd v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19922-SSP.xml')">[2017] 3 SLR 201</a> (“<em>Seng Foo</em>”) at [65], that the one transaction rule is essentially a rule of fairness resting on the notion that an offender should not be doubly punished for what is essentially the same conduct, even though that conduct might disclose several distinct offences at law. The corollary of the principle is that an accused person should not receive an unwarranted discount for what are essentially distinct offences at law even if the the offences arise out of the same conduct (<em>per</em> Chief Justice Menon at <em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em> at [69]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and 5<sup>th</sup> Charge concerned distinct conduct targeting different condominium units approximately one day apart. The proximities that are arguably present in this case – that of time and location – were in fact the very indicators of deliberate planning and steps at escaping detection, and the very factors which indicated higher culpability warranting general deterrence. I saw nothing in the present facts that would displace the general rule of consecutive offences for unrelated offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Even if I was wrong in assessing that the offences in the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and 5<sup>th</sup> Charge are distinct offences, the predominant sentencing objective of deterrence merits the imposition of consecutive imprisonment terms. In <em>Seng Foo</em>, Chief Justice Menon identified deterrence as a justification for departing from the one transaction rule at [67]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is also important to note that the [one-transaction] rule is not mandatory. In <em>Shouffee</em>, I pointed out (at [8l(b)]) that there could be circumstances where the court may well order two sentences to run consecutively even though the offences do form part of the same transaction. <em>Such circumstances would</em> include ensuring that the sentence reflects the increased culpability of the accused from multiple offending or gives sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence so as to discourage <em>the behaviour in question</em> and to ensure that the punishment is commensurate with the gravity of the offence ....</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The accused person had entered Singapore with his co-conspirators in July 2019 for the specific purpose of executing their plan to break into residential homes to commit theft of jewellery, cash and other valuable items over a few days and did in fact leave Singapore in order to avoid detection. The culpability of the accused for the entire scheme is high given that he had entered Singapore for the purpose of committing the planned offences. This proposition finds support in case law including <em>Fricker Oliver v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 1 SLR 0084.xml')">[2011] 1 SLR 84</a> at [2] and <em>PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0334.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 334</a> at [67]. In this regard, it should be emphasised that the critical inquiry is not so much whether there is a transnational element to the offences (<em>cf</em> prosecution’s submission set out at [11] above), but whether the offenders had targeted Singapore for criminal activities (see <em>Zhou Haiming v PP</em> [2017] 4 SLR 427 at [32] – [34]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Statement of Facts detailed the surreptitious manner of entry into the condominiums in order to commit the various offences, including the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and the 5<sup>th</sup> Charge. Effort was also made to evade detection as can be seen from the detailed planning down to the manner of surreptious exit and clothing changes to avoid detection. In the interests of general deterrence, a stiff overall sentence is necessary to deter foreigner accused from entering Singapore soil specifically to commit offences. The level of careful planning and premeditation, as well as culpability in attempting to repeat the offences warrants the imposition of a stiff sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Furthermore, a number of the TIC Charges related entirely to this carefully planned scheme in July 2019 (see [5] above for the the tabular summary of the TIC Charges, of which DAC-932247-2019, DAC-932248-2019, DAC932249-2019, DAC-932251-2019 and DAC-905360-2020 concerned the spate of offences committed in July 2019). These charges should be taken into account in the overall assessment of the accused person’s criminality in the following ways:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     The TIC Charges enable the court to assess the total value of items stolen as a result of the criminal scheme which is around $118,375.83, specifically the amount of loss caused <em>in addition</em> to the amounts stated in the proceeded charges (<em>ie</em>, $61,452.88); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     The TIC Charges indicate that the accused person had in fact been a part of the group of conspirators who planned and executed the plan to break into residential units at two different condominiums to commit theft of valueable property, evincing their overall high culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I turn now to deal with the prosecution’s submission that the execution of the offences in the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge and 5<sup>th</sup> Charge points to the fact that the accused and his co-conspirators were not inexperienced in conducting their break-ins. The prosecution also made the oral submission that the accused operated in a foreign syndicate. I was not able to accept the submission that the accused and co-conspirators had prior experience in offending in the absence of any evidence that the accused and co-conspirators had any prior convictions for similar property offences, and any indication in the Statement of Facts that the accused and the co-conspirators were part of a criminal syndicate. There were also no charges in respect of prior similar offences committed by the accused and his co-conspirators before the court. While the accused did return to Singapore in November 2019 to commit further offences, there was no indication that he had acted in a group or operated as part of a syndicate on that occasion.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In respect of the 8<sup>th</sup> charge, the accused’s culpability was high, even though the accused did not succeed in his attempt to break in to the residence to commit theft. It was necessary to take into account that the accused had acted not only with premeditation, but also sought to re-offend in November 2019 by breaking into the very unit that was targeted by the accused and the co-conspirators in July 2019. The accused had admitted to the Statement of Facts, which stated that DAC-905360-2020, one of the TIC Charges, concerned an earlier occasion of housebreaking to commit theft at the very same residential unit. The fact that the accused had again targeted the very same residential indicates a lack of remorse and accordingly this was treated as a culpability enhancing factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I attributed due weight to the fact that the accused had no prior antecedents, with due consideration also to the fact that the accused is foreign national who had entered Singapore for the purpose of committing a series of highly premeditated house-breaking offences and that the apprehension of the accused was through extensive police investigations. Weight was also given to the accused’s early plea of guilty, thereby obviating the resources and time occasioned by a trial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I had due regard to counsel’s submission that on a strict application of the benchmark sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment, running three sentences consecutively would result in a sentence in excess of the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the offences committed. That said, it is also established principle, following the case of <em>Shouffee</em> at [67], that the exercise of such discretion should not be such as to render a mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by law nugatory. Furthermore, as stated by the High Court in <em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em> at [81], public confidence in the administration of justice requires the avoidance of any impression or suggestion that no or little penalty is to be imposed for further offences committed after the first.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In light of the above (at [31] – [42]), it was appropriate to order that three of the imprisonment terms are to run consecutively.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Precedents cited by the parties</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I turn now to deal with the precedents specifically highlighted during submissions by both parties. Counsel for the accused impressed on the court that a crucial point of distinction from <em>Chen Jianhua</em> lay in the fact that in <em>Chen Jianhua</em>, the prosecution had proceeded on 10 rather than 3 charges of house-breaking. However, I noted that upon aggregating the totality of the loss caused to the victims for the 10 charges in <em>Chen Jianhua</em>, it was apparent that the harm caused in <em>Chen Jianhua</em> was far lower than that caused by the accused in the instant case (see factual matrix summarised at [12] above). It is trite that the court has a discretion to increase the sentences that the court might otherwise have imposed on the proceeded charges, having regard to the TIC Charges (see <em>PP v UI</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0500.xml')">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500</a> at [37] – [38]). The high degree of premeditation and planning, as well as involvement in a group offence were factors present in this case but absent in <em>Chen Jianhua</em> that merited a sentence reflective of a stronger need for deterrence of more culpable conduct.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Both parties addressed the court on the precedent of <em>PP v Garcia Cardona Martin Alonso</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22438-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 298</a> (“<em>Garcia Cardona Martin Alonso</em>”), as a relevant precedent where two out of three imprisonment terms for offences under s 457 of the Penal Code were ordered to run consecutively. The instant case was distinguishable from <em>Garcia Cardona Martin Alonso</em>, which concerned a foreigner who had arrived in Singapore as a tourist, but committed a series of three house-breaking offences in order to fund his visit over some 10 days, stealing items worth a total of $35,420. Many of the stolen items were not recovered. In <em>Garcia Cardona Martin Alonso</em>, the accused faced a total of three charges, and there were no charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The court imposed an aggregate sentence of 58 months’ imprisonment, which was arrived at by ordering two out of three imprisonment terms to run consecutively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The offender in <em>Garcia Cardona Martin Alonso</em> was less culpable than the accused in the present case, as he had initially entered Singapore as a tourist, and decided to commit a spate of three house-breaking offences over 10 days to fund his travel in Singapore. In the present case, the accused had engaged with his co-conspirators in detailed planning to commit the offences and evade detection, and had targeted Singapore for the very purpose of committing the offences over several days and leaving the country swiftly thereafter with the loot. The accused also demonstrated persistence in committing further offences, as can be seen from his decision to re-enter Singapore to commit further similar offences. In <em>Garcia Cardona Martin Alonso</em>, many of the stolen items were recovered, which went towards diminishing the effect of the offences on the victim, unlike the present case where the stolen items were not recovered.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Moderation of the individual sentences on account of the totality principle</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I was mindful of the need to not impose a sentence that was crushing in the circumstances, given that the length of the individual sentences appropriate for each of the offences (see above at [29] – [30]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Bearing in mind the appropriateness of ordering that three of the individual sentences are to run consecutively, in applying the totality principle, I moderated the individual sentences downwards, to arrive at the following individual sentences:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="30.5%"/> <col width="34.26%"/> <col width="35.24%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Individual sentence</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Revised sentence in view of totality considerations</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1<sup>st</sup> Charge</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5<sup>th</sup> Charge</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8<sup>th</sup> Charge</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">26 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Aggregate imprisonment (consecutive)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">96 months’ imprisonment </p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">84 months’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In totality, the downward moderation reduced the aggregate individual sentences by a total of 12 months’ mprisonment so as to ameliorate the effect of aggregation that might otherwise impact adversely on the accused’s rehabilitative potential (applying <em>Raveen Balakrishnan</em> at [79]). The aggregate sentence was thus 84 months’ imprisonment, which I ordered to commence with effect from 12 November 2019, the date on which the accused was first remanded.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In light of the foregoing, the Accused was sentenced to 84 months’ imprisonment, with effect from 12 November 2019.
