He was sentenced to <b>12 years' preventive detention</b>. The Accused being dissatisfied filed an appeal against his sentence. He is currently serving sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       These are the grounds for the sentence imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The proceeded charge read as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b>DAC 920093 of 2020</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">    You, Salim Bin Abdul Rahman, are charged that you, on 1 October 2020, at or about 2.00 p.m., at the staircase landing located at the ground floor of [<em>address</em>], Singapore, did use criminal force on [<em>victim</em>], a person under 14 years of age (female, 10 years old, D.O.B: xx March 2010) (the “victim”), to wit, by putting your left hand over the victim’s shoulders and touching her once on her left chest (over her clothes), knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the victim, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statement of Facts </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Statement of Facts (SOF) which the accused admitted without qualification, is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    The accused is Salim Bin Abdul Rahman, a 61-year-old male Singaporean (D.O.B: 20 December 1959). The accused was working as a cleaner at Serangoon North Shopping Centre at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    The victim-cum-complainant is [<em>victim’s name</em>], a 10-year-old female Singaporean (D.O.B: xx March 2010). At the material time, she was a Primary 4 student at [<em>school</em>], and was residing at [<em>address</em>] (the “Residence”).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    The witness is [<em>witness’s name</em>], a 68-year-old female Singaporean. She is the victim’s grandparent.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b><u>FIRST INFORMATION REPORT</u></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    On 1 October 2020, at about 3.34 p.m., the victim lodged a police report stating that she was molested by a male subject. The male subject was subsequently established to be the accused. The incident location was given as the staircase landing located at the ground floor of the Residence [<em>address</em>] (the “Staircase”).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b><u>BACKGROUND FACTS</u></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    On 1 October 2020, the victim ended her lessons at about 1.40 p.m. She proceeded to take a bus home, and alighted at the bus stop near her Residence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    At about 1.46 p.m., while the victim was walking under the sheltered walkway leading to her Residence, she felt someone touching her shoulders from her back. She turned around, and saw the accused. The accused asked the victim where she lived and which school she attended. As the victim did not recognise the accused, she ignored him and did not answer his questions.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    Despite the victim’s refusal to answer his questions, the accused persisted in striking a conversation with the victim. The accused took out $1.50 from his pocket, handed it to the victim, and told her to keep the $1.50. The victim accepted the $1.50, as she was afraid to incur the wrath of the accused should she reject his gesture. The accused then held the victim’s right hand and told her to follow him to his house.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    On the same day, at or about 2.00 p.m., the accused and the victim arrived at the Staircase. As the accused was about to make his way up the stairs, the victim refused to follow the accused. The victim informed the accused that she wanted to return home to have her lunch. Thereat, the accused put his left hand over the victim’s shoulders, and touched her once on her left chest (over her clothes). The victim was frightened, and made a dash towards the direction of her Residence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    Upon returning home, the victim started crying and informed the witness of her encounter with the accused. The witness tried to calm the victim down, and brought the victim to the police station to lodge a police report.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    On the same day, at or about 3.34 p.m., the victim lodged a police report at [<em>redacted</em>] Neighbourhood Police Post.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    Through the Police’s investigative efforts, the identity of the accused was traced. He was arrested on the same day at about 8.06 p.m..</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b><u>FACTS RELATING TO THE CHARGE</u></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    Investigations revealed that on 1 October 2020, at about 1.40 p.m., the accused spotted the victim on the bus. At the material time, the accused noticed that the victim was in her school uniform.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    On the same day, sometime before 1.46 p.m., the accused alighted from the bus and realised that the victim had gotten off at the same stop as him. The accused stated that he then decided to approach the victim as he had “<em>evil thoughts of doing something bad</em>” and wanted himself to “<em>feel good</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    At about 1.46 p.m., acting on his “<em>evil thoughts</em>”, the accused approached the victim while the victim was walking under the sheltered walkway. The accused asked the victim where she lived and which school she attended. He then gave $1.50 to the victim, and asked the victim to follow him.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    At or about 2.00 p.m., the accused and the victim arrived at the Staircase. The accused recalled that thereat, the victim informed him that she had to return home. The accused then placed his left hand over the victim’s shoulders, and touched the victim once on her left chest (over her clothes). Thereafter, the accused and the victim parted ways.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <b><u>PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT OF THE ACCUSED</u></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    Following the accused’s arrest, the accused was examined by Dr Stephen Phang, a Senior Consultant at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). The report stated that the accused did not suffer from any psychiatric disorder or illness, and he was not of unsound mind at the time of the commission of the offence. Dr Stephen Phang opined that the accused has a high risk of reoffending.

The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    The accused admits to the commission of the abovementioned offence, and stands charged accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification and accordingly, he was convicted of the proceeded charge.

clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Address on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least 12 years of preventive detention (“<b>PD</b>”) would be expedient for the protection of the public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The learned DPP submitted that the accused satisfies the pre-conditions laid down in s 304(2)(a) CPC as he is above the age of 30 years, and he is convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted at least 3 times since he reached the age of 16 years of offences punishable with such a sentence. Specifically, the learned DPP highlighted that there were seven (7) such occasions between the period of 1990 to 2009 where the accused was sentenced to imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The learned DPP submitted that the accused’s antecedents showed that he is a habitual criminal, exhibiting a wide range of criminality, and he had re-offended with a degree of regularity and has displayed a consistent pattern of criminal behaviour.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Further, the accused is a menace to society and poses a high degree of danger to the community at large. The learned DPP highlighted that he was released from PD on 27 December 2019 and committed the present offence within 10 months after his release. He had targeted the young victim and deployed strikingly similar modus operandi as the offences committed in 2009, where he was sentenced to 10 years’ PD for nine (9) counts under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. This included pretending to ask his victims for direction, offering them pocket money, and bringing them to a secluded place (e.g. staircase landing) to molest them. The accused had displayed paedophilic sexual interest and preyed on the young victim for his own sexual gratification.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     More pertinently, Dr Stephen Phang, the Senor Consultant Psychiatrist had assessed the accused and opined that he has a high risk of re-offending. Similarly, in the PD suitability report, the accused was assessed to belong to a group of prisoners with a 43.8% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release. Crucially, his risk of sexual violence re-offending was assessed to be in the high range.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The learned DPP highlighted that the accused sought to trivialise his offending behaviour and attempted to downplay his criminality when he stated that “<em>I have no intention to ‘spoil’ / do more serious sexual acts on the victim; there are others [in prison] who committed very serious sexual offences like rape.</em>”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Given the seriousness of the accused’s antecedents and his persistence in offending, the learned DPP submitted a sentence of at least 12 years’ PD would be expedient for the protection of the public, and that the focus of the sentence should be the incapacitation of the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In this respect, the learned DPP submitted that the accused ought to be taken out of circulation altogether in order that he be not afforded even the slightest opportunity to give sway to his criminal tendencies again for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     His previous incarceration of 10 years’ PD did nothing to deter him from further re-offending. He re-offended within 4 months upon released from his previous sentence of PD in respect of the TIC charges, and the present offence under s 354(2) of the Penal Code was committed within 10 months upon his release.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the PD suitability report, the accused has poor family and emotional support, and there are no protective factors which would help to protect or prevent him from re-offending.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     The present sexual offence which he committed against a vulnerable victim is strikingly similar to his previous offending in terms of victim profile, as well as the nature and circumstances of the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     The accused’s reoffending shortly upon his release, coupled with his high risk of sexual violence reoffending, calls for a specific deterrence in addition to general deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     The principle of escalation justifies imposing a longer sentence on the persistent offender in view of is antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation Plea</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In his mitigation plea, the accused pleaded for a light sentence and promised the court that he will not reoffend. He apologised for the offences which he had committed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The accused further informed the court that he wished to find a job and get married as he is not young anymore. He further urged the court to consider his medical conditions, namely, diabetes, insomnia and skin allergy.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Considerations</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The main question that the court has to consider is whether a sentence of PD ought to be imposed, and if so, what would be the appropriate length of the PD sentence. Under s 304(2) CPC, the length of PD that the court can impose is a period of between seven (7) and 20 years.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Law relating to Preventive Detention</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The general principles relating to PD are clearly set out by the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v Syed Hamid bin A Kadir Alhamid</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 2 SLR(R) 1018.xml')">[2002] 2 SLR(R) 1018</a> at [10]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    A sentence of preventive detention is intended for habitual offenders, aged more than 30 years, whom the court considers to be too recalcitrant for reformation (see <em>PP v Wong Wing Hung</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0304.xml')">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 304</a>). Preventive detention ought to be imposed if the accused has shown that he is such a menace to society that he should be incarcerated for a substantial period of time (see <em>PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0145.xml')">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 145</a>). While the court will consider the need for the public to be protected from physical bodily harm, offences against property, such as theft, offences against the peace, such as affray, and offences against society in general, such as the consumption and possession of drugs, may also be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate for an order of preventive detention to be made. In <em>Tan Ngin Hai v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0152.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152</a> at [8], Yong Pung How CJ explained:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">… In my view, there is no rule of law which states that protection of the public necessarily refers to protecting them only from physical bodily harm … As such, the imposition of preventive detention ought not to be restricted only to persons with a history of violent behaviour as exhibited through the commission of violent crimes. Instead, the real test is whether or not the degree of propensity towards any type of criminal activity at all is such that the offender ought to be taken out of circulation altogether in order that he be not afforded even the slightest opportunity to give sway to his criminal tendencies again. …</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In <em>PP v Rosli bin Yassin</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 2 SLR 0831.xml')">[2013] 2 SLR 831</a>, the Court of Appeal in enhancing the Respondent’s sentence to the maximum possible duration of 20 years’ PD, observed the following at [11]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    The overarching principle is the need to <em>protect the public</em> (indeed, this principle is to be found in the express language of s 12(2) of the CPC itself (see above at [3])). This does not mean that the situation of the individual offender is irrelevant. However, the applicable principles in this particular regard are formulated with the <em>public</em> interest as the central point of reference constantly in view. Put simply, if the individual offender is such a habitual offender whose situation does not admit of the possibility of his or her reform, thus constituting a menace to the public (and this would include, but not limited to, offences involving violence), a sentence of preventive detention would be imposed on him or her for a substantial period of time in order to protect the public. As Yong Pung How CJ put it in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>PP v Wong Wing Hung</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0304.xml')">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 304</a> (“<em>Wong Wing Hung</em>”) at [10], the “sentence [of preventive detention] is meant essentially for <em>habitual</em> offenders, who must be over the age of 30 years, whom the court considers to be <em>beyond redemption and too recalcitrant for reformation</em>” [emphasis added]. The court will look at the <em>totality</em> of the offender’s previous convictions (see the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Tan Ngin Hai v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0152.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152</a> at [7]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In assessing whether PD is an appropriate sentence, I drew guidance from the case of <em>Sim Yeow Kee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19663-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 936</a> (“<em>Sim Yeow Kee</em>”), where the High Court comprising a panel of 3 Judges set out the sentencing framework that should be adopted when considering cases involving corrective training (“CT”). The court considered the background to the CT regime, the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) and the Conditional Remission Scheme (“CRS”), and observed that PD has, broadly speaking, taken a similar course as CT since its introduction in Singapore by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance 1954.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The High Court laid down a two-step analytical framework in assessing whether CT is an appropriate sentence on the facts of a particular case. In the first stage, the court considers whether the offender in question satisfies the technical requirements under the s 304(1) CPC for CT to be imposed. If this is satisfied, the court then considers at the second stage, whether it is “expedient with a view to [the offender’s] reformation and the prevention of crime” that the offender be sentenced to CT. A three-step framework is adopted at the second stage of sentencing, and the question for the court is whether the interests of specific deterrence and reformation warrant the imposition of CT: <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> at [98]. I found it useful to adopt the two-step analytical framework for CT, save that the expression of the wordings for PD required a modification to the analysis for the second stage.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stage 1 – Does the offender satisfy the technical requirements for preventive detention to be imposed?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The accused clearly met the technical requirements for PD as set out in s 304(2)(a) CPC. The accused, at 61 years of age, is a person above the age of 30 years. The prescribed imprisonment term for an offence under s 354(2) of the Penal Code is one which may extend to 5 years. The accused antecedents also showed that since attaining the age of 16 years old, the accused had been convicted at least three (3) times of offences punishable with an imprisonment term of 2 years or more, and was sentenced to imprisonment. In fact, the accused was last sentenced to 10 years’ PD in 2009 for outrage of modesty offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     To assess the accused’s suitability for PD, the court called for a pre-sentencing report. The accused was medically examined and found to be in generally good physical condition but suffers from diabetes, dyslipidaemia, eczema, and cataract. He was also assessed by a psychiatrist and found to be of normal mental condition with no current indication of any major mental illness. The PD report assessed the accused to be suitable for the PD regime.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The PD report assessed the accused’s general risk of criminal recidivism to be in the <b><u>Moderate-High Risk/Need</u></b> level of criminal re-offending. According to the report, the accused belongs to a group of prisoners with a 43.8% probability of recidivism within two years of release. In terms of his specific risk of sexual violence re-offending, the accused was assessed to be in the <b><u>High</u></b> range. He committed contact sexual offences at a moderate frequency and severity (low physical harm but high in psychological harm) which occurred within 10 months after he was released from his previous incarceration for sexual offences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stage 2 – Whether it is expedient to sentence the accused to preventive detention for the protection of the public </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As evident from the IMH report, the accused admitted that he had been motivated to approach, accost and molest the young female victim by a sense of lust.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> He admitted that he felt good, like “<em>steam”</em> and <em>“shiok”</em> when he touched the young victim. The accused exhibited paedophilic sexual interest and his risk of re-offending was assessed by Dr Stephen Phang to be high.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As highlighted by the learned DPP, the accused’s antecedents showed a worrying proclivity for committing sexual offences against young children. In 2009, he was sentenced to 10 years’ PD for nine (9) counts under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. His modus operandi for his previous 2009 offences included pretending to ask his victims for directions, offering them money, and bringing them to a secluded place (e.g. staircase landing) to molest them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present offence, the Statement of Facts revealed that the accused had used a similar modus operandi to commit the offence. The accused first spotted the young victim on the bus and noticed that she was in her school uniform. When she alighted at the same bus stop as him, he decided to prey on her as he wanted to “<em>feel good</em>” and acted on his “<em>evil thoughts</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The accused approached the victim from her back, touched her shoulders, and engaged her in conversation by asking her where she lived and which school she attended. When the victim ignored him, the accused persisted and gave her money ($1.50) before he pulled her by her right hand, and told her to follow him to his house. At the Staircase landing, when the victim refused to follow the accused further and informed him that she wanted to return home, the accused then molested the victim. The facts revealed that the 10-year old victim was clearly frightened, and she dashed home and cried.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I note that the accused has had a history of drug and property offences, and his sexual offences against female children aged seven to 14 years old began when the accused was about 50 years old. When he spotted victims alone in public places, and found them to be pretty and developed the urge to touch them, he would use the similar modus operandi to molest the victims.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     While the offences were mainly opportunistic and occurred due to his impulsivity and lack of consequential thinking, I agreed with the prosecution that the accused is a menace to society and poses a high degree of danger to the community at large. I further note that the PD report stated that the accused committed contact sexual offences at a moderate frequency and moderate severity with low physical harm but high in psychological harm. His current sexual offence occurred barely 10 months after he was released from a 10-year PD sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Of concern is the accused’s negative attitude and sense of entitlement when he sought to minimise the severity of his sexual offence by stating that he had no intention to “spoil” or “do more serious sexual acts on the victim”; and that “there are others [in prison] who committed very serious sexual offences like rape.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Notwithstanding that the accused knew that what he did was wrong and had negatively affected his victim, he believed that his sexual acts on his victim were not serious and attempted to downplay his criminality.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the PD report, the Risk Findings placed the accused in the <b><u>Moderate-High Risk / Need</u></b> level of criminal re-offending. He belonged to a group of prisoners with a 43.8% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release. More significantly, his specific risk of sexual violence re-offending was assessed to be in the <b><u>High</u></b> range. He committed the present offence within 10 months after he was released from his previous incarceration for sexual offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I also considered the accused protective factors and family support, and I note that the accused reported a close relationship with his mother who is his form of emotional support. However, he shared that his aged 89-year old mother is unwell, and he is unable to confide in her like he used to. He indicated that the lack of family support and the criticism he encountered from his siblings resulted in his emotional distress. Quite evidently, the accused has poor family and emotional support. There are no protective factors which would help to protect or prevent the accused from re-offending. The fact that the accused had re-offended by committing the theft offences within 4 months upon his release from PD underscored his inability to be rehabilitated.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For these reasons, I agreed with the prosecution that the facts painted a disconcerting picture of an offender who displayed paedophilic sexual interest, and one who sought to trivialise his offending behaviour and downplay his criminality. The accused was not deterred from using a similar modus operandi to prey on a young victim, and re-offended soon after his release from his previous incarceration for sexual offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Considering the seriousness of the accused’s history of criminal behaviour, the severity of the 10-year PD previously imposed, his persistence in re-offending, and the high risk of the accused re-offending as assessed by Stephen Phang in the IMH report and PD suitability report, I was satisfied that it would be expedient for the protection of the public that the accused should be sentenced to PD.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I next consider the length of the PD to impose. The prosecution submitted that his previous incarceration of 10 years’ PD did nothing to deter the accused from further re-offending. He re-offended in respect of the TIC charges barely within 4 months upon released. The present sexual offence against the young victim under s 354(2) of the Penal Code was committed within 10 months upon his release from PD.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The learned DPP further submitted that the principle of escalation justified imposing a longer sentence on a persistent offender in view of his antecedents, and submitted for a sentence of at least 12 years’ PD.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The accused urged the court to impose a sentence of less than 10 years’ PD. He informed the court that when he was sentenced to 10 years of PD previously, he was caught by surprise as he had never been sent for Corrective Training (“CT”). He pleaded for leniency and promised that he would change for the better.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     While I accept that the accused had pleaded guilty, and noted his expression of remorse for having committed the offences, it was also clear that from his previous antecedents and the IMH report and PD suitability report that his risk of re-offending is high.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Considering that the accused was previously sentenced to 10 years of PD, and he committed the sexual offence against a young victim barely 10 months after he was last released from his previous term of PD using a strikingly similar modus operandi, I agreed with the prosecution that the principle of escalation is engaged, and a slight uplift from his previous PD term is warranted for the protection of the public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In this respect, I agreed with the prosecution that the focus of the sentence should be the incapacitation of the accused. Accordingly, I was of the view that a sentence of 12 years’ PD would be expedient for the protection of the public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I will briefly touch on the question of proportionality. In <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em>, the High Court commented at [97]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">97    In the context of PD, general deterrence and the social value in keeping a hardened criminal out of circulation provide a legitimate basis and operative justification for the application of this regime. Thus, we consider that considerations of proportionality would not apply rigorously in such circumstances. Here too, these considerations would have limited scope for displacing the imposition of a term of PD where such a sentence would otherwise be warranted. However, we reject the notion that it has no application whatsoever. We note that in <em>Tan Ngin Hai v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0152.xml')">[2001]2 SLR(R)152</a>, the offender was sentenced to eight years’ PD for stealing coins amounting to $1.10 from a van. The court considered it appropriate to do so because it was satisfied that it was “dealing with” an offender who was “deeply” entrenched in the criminal way of life, as could be seen from his past convictions. With great respect, we find ourselves unable to endorse the view that the principle of proportionality is so wholly to be disregarded that incarceration for such duration can fairly be justified for the theft of a few coins.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     While it is acknowledged that the principle of proportionality would not apply rigorously, it is also not to be wholly disregarded. In this respect, I was of the view that a substantial period of incarceration is called for to specifically deter the accused. The accused is 61 years of age, and barely 10 months after his release from PD, he re-offended and committed a serious sexual offence against a vulnerable victim using a strikingly similar modus operandi as his previous offences. Motivated by lust, the accused accosted the lone 10-year old victim, offered her money, and then brought the young victim to a secluded area to commit the offence. Considering that his risk of sexual violence re-offending is high, it would clearly be expedient to sentence the accused to a longer period of PD for the protection of the public.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In summary, the accused re-offended barely 10 months after he was last released from his previous term of 10 years’ PD. His modus operandi for the offence is strikingly similar, in that, he would offer the young victim money, and bringing them to a secluded place such as a staircase landing to commit the offence of outrage of modesty against the vulnerable victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     What is also of concern is that the accused had displayed paedophilic sexual interest and he sought to trivialise his offending behaviour and downplay his criminality. His lack of social and emotional support to mitigate his risk of re-offending was also a factor that the court considered. Finally, the IMH report and the PD suitability report clearly indicated that the accused’s risk of sexual re-offending is high.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Accordingly, the principle of escalation is appropriate and a slight uplift from his previous PD term is warranted for the protection of the public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     All considered, the Accused was sentenced to <b>twelve (12) years' preventive detention</b>. The sentence of PD was ordered to take effect from 3 October 2020, which was the date of his remand.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Accused being dissatisfied with the decision had lodged an appeal against his sentence. He is currently serving sentence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>DP Report, page 5.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>IMH Report, page 4, paragraph 14.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>DP Report, page 4.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap4 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
