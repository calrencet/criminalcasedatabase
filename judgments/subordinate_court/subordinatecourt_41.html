<em>claimed trial</em> to a charge under section 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for forging a discharge voucher in relation to an insurance claim. At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of the offence. I sentenced him to a term of 10 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Accused being dissatisfied with the <em>sentence</em> has filed an appeal. He is currently on <em>bail pending appeal</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the conclusion of the trial, I had issued brief oral grounds to explain my decision to convict the Accused. These are available in the transcripts for 22 September 2020 at pages 1 to 6. As the Accused is only appealing against his sentence, I shall focus on setting out the reasons for my decision on sentence in these grounds.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The details of the charge on which the Accused was convicted were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>DAC 908310-2017</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You […] are charged that you, on or about 6 November 2014, in Singapore, did forge a document which purports to be a valuable security, to wit, a Tenet Sompo Insurance Pte Ltd Discharge Voucher for claim no. 01-041130511 dated 6 November 2014 for S$15,000, with the intention of causing it to be believed that it was signed by one Adrian Matthew Lee, and you have committed an offence punishable under section 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As the Accused has not appealed against his conviction, it is not necessary to set out the details of the evidence led during the trial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The salient facts pertaining to the charge have been succinctly summarised by the prosecution at [4] of their opening statement (PS1). As these were either undisputed facts or corresponded with my findings of fact at the conclusion of the case, I shall broadly adopt the prosecution’s summary in briefly setting out the facts relating to the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 2 August 2013, the Accused was driving motor vehicle SKA7198G (a Porsche) when it was involved in a traffic accident (“the accident”) with a cement mixer insured by Tenet Sompo Insurance Pte Ltd (“Tenet Sompo”). The owner of SKA7198G was Lee Hwai San Adrian Matthew (“Lee”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sometime in February 2014, Tenet Sompo received a letter of demand from the lawyers representing Lee, claiming damages in relation to the accident. This was followed by a Writ of Summons in April 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In October 2014, the owners of the cement mixer forwarded an email from the Accused to Tenet Sompo’s assistant manager, Han Cheung Yong Bernard (PW1 - “Han”). In the Accused’s email, he stated that he wanted to settle the matter directly with Tenet Sompo. Han and the Accused then commenced negotiations for a settlement of the accident claim via email and telephone calls.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Following the negotiations, Han made an offer to settle the claim in the global sum of $15,000. He sent the Accused a discharge voucher, with the request that the Accused ask Lee to sign it and accept the sum of $15,000 in full and final settlement of “all claims, cost and disbursements arising from personal injury or loss or damage to property” sustained by Lee as a result of the accident. The discharge voucher included a clause which authorised Tenet Sompo to pay the full settlement sum to the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Subsequently, the Accused returned the signed discharge voucher dated 6 November 2014 (Exhibit P2) to Han via email. The discharge voucher was purportedly signed by Lee as the “claimant” and the Accused as the “witness” and set out their respective personal particulars.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Tenet Sompo proceeded to draw a cheque dated 11 November 2014 for $15,000 in favour of the Accused (Exhibit P4). Han deposited the cheque into the Accused’s personal bank account as specified by him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Sometime in January 2015, Tenet Sompo received a call from the lawyers acting for Lee informing them that the signature of Lee on the discharge voucher was forged. Thereafter Tenet Sompo recorded a telephone conversation between their manager, Ms Ong Lay Gim and the Accused (as well as Lee’s lawyer Ms Anjalli d/o Muniandy; PW6 – “Ms Anjalli”) wherein the Accused admitted to forging Lee’s signature in the discharge voucher and offered to pay the sum of $15,000 back to Tenet Sompo (Exhibits P5 and P5A).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 30 April 2015, Han filed a police report (Exhibit P1) stating that the Accused had forged Lee’s signature in the discharge voucher. During the course of police investigations, the Accused admitted in a statement recorded from him on 20 November 2015 (Exhibit P7) that he had signed Lee’s signature in the discharge voucher without Lee’s knowledge and that he had spent the $15,000 as he suffered losses in US stocks.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It was not disputed during the trial that the Accused had signed on the discharge voucher with what was purportedly the signature of Lee, and that Lee did not sign the voucher himself. The defence case was that the Accused had Lee’s authorisation to sign the discharge voucher and as such, did not act fraudulently or dishonestly. At the conclusion of the trial, I found as a fact that the Accused did not have Lee’s authorisation to sign the discharge voucher on his behalf. As I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt, I found him guilty and convicted him of the same.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Accused had the following related antecedents:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="33.1%"/> <col width="33%"/> <col width="33.9%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Date of Conviction</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Offence</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sentence</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="4" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 September 2008</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 379 Cap 224</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Theft</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 months’ imprisonment</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consecutive)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 379 Cap 224</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Theft</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 months’ imprisonment</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(concurrent)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 380 Cap 224</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Theft in dwelling-house</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 months’ imprisonment</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consecutive)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">With 3 charges under S 379, S 381, and S 380 Cap 224 taken into consideration. </p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prescribed Punishment</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Section 467 of the Penal Code provided that an offender “shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine”.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The prosecution tendered written submissions on sentence and sought an imprisonment term of at least 11 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The prosecution began by highlighting the aggravating factors as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     The amount involved, $15,000, was significant. This was further exacerbated by the fact that the Accused had pocketed the entire sum for his personal expenses.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     The offence was clearly premeditated.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     There were two victims in the present case. Tenet Sompo was deceived by the forgery to issue the cheque for $15,000 to the Accused; while Lee was left with a bill for the repairs conducted on his vehicle without compensation from the insurers, in relation to an accident he had nothing to do with.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     There was a clear abuse of trust when the Accused represented that he was authorised to speak to Tenet Sompo on behalf of Lee. More significantly, the Accused had abused Lee’s trust in him.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Accused had exploited the use of email correspondence and took advantage of the fact that Tenet Sompo did not require Lee to personally attend at their office, or for an employee of Tenet Sompo to witness Lee signing the discharge voucher. The Accused’s deception was two-fold, by forging Lee’s signature, as well as signing as a witness himself. Han had testified that the Accused had expressly asked if he could be the witness. This was part of the Accused’s elaborate scheme to convince Tenet Sompo that he had witnessed Lee signing on the discharge voucher. As paperless transactions were becoming more commonplace, the prosecution argued that there was an increasing need to deter like-minded offenders.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Accused was traced and was sentenced to a global term of nine months’ imprisonment for theft offences in 2008. As the Accused committed the present offence about six years after his previous conviction, some weight ought to be placed on specific deterrence considerations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The prosecution also submitted that there were minimal mitigating factors in this case:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Firstly, the Accused did not plead guilty.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the prosecution observed that the Accused’s conduct of his defence supported the prosecution’s submissions that he was unremorseful. The Accused had claimed, belatedly during the trial, that he was not on the call recorded in P5. He also claimed for the first time at trial that he had been authorised by Lee to sign on the discharge voucher despite expressly denying so in his police statement and in P5. This resulted in significant expenditure of resources with an additional trial date being taken to call the prosecution’s rebuttal witness, Ms Anjalli, to take the stand and rebut the Accused’s lies.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, the Accused made restitution at a very late stage on 9 February 2021, more than four months after he had been convicted, and just three weeks shy of the sentencing hearing. As such, the prosecution submitted that the Accused’s restitution in the present case was not made out of genuine remorse, but in a bid to obtain a lighter punishment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On the other hand, the prosecution acknowledged that some mitigating weight should be accorded to the restitution made by the Accused, to account for the reduction in harm to Tenet Sompo. However, the prosecution submitted that only minimal mitigating weight should be given. This was because while Tenet Sompo has received the return of the $15,000, its loss was not limited to the sum that it had paid out to the Accused some six years ago. Instead, because of the Accused’s forgery, the competing insurance claims between the vehicles’ insurers remained outstanding. Thus, it would be inaccurate to claim that Tenet Sompo has not suffered at all as a result of the belated restitution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The prosecution proceeded to set out the details in three sentencing precedents: <em>PP v Sani bin Mohamed Salim</em>, <em>PP v Martin Raymond Tua Pardede</em>, and <em>PP v Agnes Tan Mei Qing</em> (all unreported) and submitted that they supported a sentence of about nine months’ imprisonment for a section 467 Penal Code offence involving $15,000, some degree of premeditation and no restitution. An uplift should then be applied to account for the discount that would have be given pursuant to the plea of guilt in the precedent cases, resulting in a starting point of at least 12 months’ imprisonment. Further, the prosecution submitted that a one-month reduction should be provided, to take into consideration the restitution that was made. Therefore, in the round, the Accused should be sentenced to at least 11 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation &amp; Defence’s Submissions on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defence tendered a written plea in mitigation and submissions on sentence and sought a custodial sentence of three months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In support of its sentencing position, the defence submitted the following mitigating and relevant sentencing factors for the Court’s consideration:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Accused had made full restitution to Tenet Sompo.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was little, if any, premeditation involved. The accident was neither planned nor intentional.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     Lee was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for cheating offences committed against the Accused, but had since fled Singapore and remained outside jurisdiction.<em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></em> As Lee was heavily indebted to the Accused, the Accused committed the offence to set off what was owed to him by Lee. The Accused did not set out to cause wrongful loss to Tenet Sompo or the repairer of Lee’s vehicle. As such, the offences were not committed out of greed but borne out of a misplaced sense of vigilantism.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Accused has learnt his lesson and vowed never to take the law into his own hands again.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defence submitted that for an offence under section 467 of the Penal Code, the governing considerations in sentencing would be the nature of the documents, the amount involved, elements of planning and organisation, the period over which the offence was committed and the abuse of position.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The defence highlighted the cases of <em>PP v Malinda Wongpipatkasem</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23617-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 197</a> (“<em>Malinda</em>”), <em>PP v Noriza Binte Aziz</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17500-SSP.xml')">[2015] SGDC 157</a> (<em>“Noriza</em>”) and <em>PP v Siti Safiah Binte Mohamed Alifah</em> (unreported, “<em>Siti Safiah</em>”) and made the following submissions:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     Forging a discharge voucher was by no means more egregious than forging a cheque, the latter of which was more susceptible to fraudulent purposes.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Accused has made full restitution, thus reducing the harm suffered by the victim(s).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     Unlike the sentencing precedents cited by the defence, the current offence was committed on only one occasion and the fraud was not perpetrated against any financial institution or public body.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defence urged the Court to take into account the fact that Tenet Sompo had somewhat contributed to its own loss by making a mistake in paying the $15,000 to the Accused instead of Lee. The Accused had also asked Han whether he required an authorisation letter from Lee but Han failed to follow up.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defence submitted that in this case, the degree of culpability and harm could not be said to be higher than that in the case of <em>Malinda</em> but was undoubtedly much lesser than that in the case of <em>Noriza</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     While the defence accepted that general and specific deterrence ought to take centre stage, it was submitted that the facts did not warrant a custodial sentence of more than three months.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s reply</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In their oral response to the defence’s submissions, the prosecution argued that even if it were true that the Accused’s motivation in committing the offence was to recover monies that had been cheated from him, no mitigating weight could be placed on this point. As observed by the Court in <em>Public Prosecutor v Chen Young Ja</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17223-SSP.xml')">[2014] SGDC 454</a> (“<em>Chen Young Ja</em>”) at [25], to do otherwise would send a wrong signal to like-minded offenders that the Court would take kindly to misconceived acts of self-help and unjust entitlement. Further, the prosecution submitted that it was not clear what the Accused’s true motivation was because he made no mention of this issue even in his police statement in P7. Instead, in the statement, the Accused simply mentioned that he was sorry and that he had already apologised to Lee and would return the sum. According to the prosecution, investigations revealed that Lee eventually made full restitution of $65,000 (which was the total amount stated in the charges against Lee) to the Accused. In fact, Lee had made $19,000 worth of restitution even before he was charged by the police for that matter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The prosecution further submitted that the precedents cited by the defence were not particularly useful as their facts were easily distinguishable. The prosecution pointed out that in the case of <em>Malinda</em>, each charge involved $6000 and the Accused was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment per charge. Further, the offender in <em>Malinda</em> was untraced and had pleaded guilty. As the Accused’s charge involved $15,000, the sentence meted out in <em>Malinda</em> could not simply be applied to the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     With regard to <em>Noriza</em>, the offender faced 209 charges in all and there were 30 proceeded charges under section 467 of the Penal Code. Given the sheer number of charges, the prosecution submitted that there would be heavy considerations of totality, proportionality and the weight to be placed on the charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Such considerations would not feature in a single charge case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As for the unreported case of <em>Siti Safiah</em>, the prosecution submitted that the Accused was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment on each charge for the eight proceeded charges under section 467 of the Penal Code, involving amounts ranging from $1,800.50 to $3,850.20 and this was upheld on appeal. Although no restitution was made in that case, the prosecution submitted that the sentences meted out in <em>Siti Safiah</em> actually supported the prosecution’s sentencing position. While the offenders had offended numerous times in the precedents cited by the defence, this would generally be considered in the global sentence when the Court determined how many sentences to run consecutively.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Finally, the prosecution noted that the defence appeared to be suggesting that Tenet Sompo was somewhat at fault because if Han had not issued the cheque in the Accused’s name, the Accused would not have succeeded in the offence. The prosecution submitted that it would not lie in an offender’s mouth to blame another for his successful commission of an offence. The fact that this argument was being made at this juncture showed an absolute lack of remorse on the part of the Accused and there was no insight into his culpability even at this point.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In view of the above, and the fact that the Accused was traced, the full picture before the Court was that specific deterrence considerations must weigh very heavily in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence’s response</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In their brief oral response to the prosecution’s reply submissions, the defence clarified that it was not the Accused’s intention to point fingers towards Tenet Sompo. The defence was merely saying that the Accused’s culpability had to be considered in light of the facts which were canvassed during the trial.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The defence also submitted that the Accused’s antecedents were dated and urged the Court to place limited weight on them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The defence further argued that it would not be accurate for the prosecution to say that Lee was now left to foot the bill for the repairs without compensation from Tenet Sompo, as Lee would be entitled to argue that he did not authorise the Accused to sign the discharge voucher. Further, as pointed out by the prosecution, the matter was still being litigated.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The defence pointed out that the precedents cited by the prosecution were unreported and should therefore be confined to their own facts. Further, no restitution was made in two of the precedents and the quantum in question was way larger than that in the current case. Most importantly, the offences in the precedents were committed on multiple occasions over lengthy durations of time whereas the current offence was one-off.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As for the restitution made by Lee to the Accused, the Accused’s position was that the actual quantum involved exceeded $100,000. Therefore, the Accused was of the view that full restitution had not been made.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In calibrating sentence, I first considered the specific facts and circumstances of the case in assessing the overall culpability of the Accused and the harm caused by the offence he committed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     With respect to the culpability of the Accused, I took into consideration the following sentencing factors present in this case. Firstly, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that the offence was clearly premeditated and carefully executed by the Accused. In my view, one did not have to look further than P2, the document which was forged, to discern that the Accused had clearly taken pains to disguise the fact that he had forged Lee’s signature; by using a pen with a different colour to append a signature which was quite distinct from his own (with which he signed as witness).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Accused had also filled in the personal particulars of Lee to lend authenticity to the forged signature and ensure that everything appeared to be in order on the face of the document. As pointed out by the prosecution, the Accused’s signature as witness on the discharge voucher was also significant as this circumvented the other built in verification feature of having a third party witness the claimant’s signature.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I had also carefully considered the defence’s submission that the Accused had not committed the offence out of greed, but rather to set off what was owed to him by Lee. In this connection, it was interesting to note that during the trial, while the Accused did mention that Lee had cheated him of close to $100,000, he had relied on this to explain why he <em>would not forge</em> Lee’s signature:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">So subsequently, I think he turned hos--- I think he was in some financial problem, so, he turned pretty hostile when he actually realised that I made a police report against him for cheating me of close to 100,000. So, <em>in fact, it actually makes no sense that I would forge his signature for 15,000 when he actually owes me more than 100,000</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As pointed out by the prosecution, it was also pertinent to note that the Accused did not mention this alleged motivation in his statement in P7, which was recorded on 20 November 2015. On the contrary, the Accused expressly stated in P7 that the reason for him forging Lee’s signature was “… so that [he] can settle this faster with Toh Painting…”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Further, even if it were true that the Accused committed the offence to recover what he thought was rightfully due to him from Lee, this could in no way diminish his culpability for the offence. This was because the direct and proximate target of the Accused’s fraudulent conduct was Tenet Sompo, an innocent third party, and not Lee. In any case, I was in complete agreement with the remarks of the Court in <em>Chen Young Ja</em> at [25] that the Court should not allow or condone offenders taking the law into their own hands.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     At this juncture, I should also mention that I disagreed with the defence’s submissions that the fraud in this case was not perpetrated against any financial institution. In my view, insurance companies like Tenet Sompo were engaged in the delivery of financial services such as the provision and underwriting of motor insurance, and should be regarded as financial institutions. That said, in the context of the current offence, and as the prosecution did not submit on this point, I did not regard this as an aggravating factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On the other hand, while I agreed with the prosecution that the Accused had abused the trust of both Tenet Sompo and Lee when he represented that he was authorised to speak to Tenet Sompo on Lee’s behalf, as well as forged Lee’s signature, I was of the view that the degree of breach of trust was limited in this case. This was because there was no pre-existing relationship of trust between Tenet Sompo and the Accused. As for Lee, aside from allowing the Accused to drive SKA7198G, it was not entirely clear from the evidence led during the trial whether he had entrusted the Accused to negotiate or settle his claim for damages.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In addition, I was not persuaded by the prosecution’s argument that the Accused had exploiting the use of email correspondence and, with the increase in paperless transactions, there was a need to deter like-minded offenders. In my view, it was not so much email correspondence that the Accused exploited but rather the fact that Tenet Sompo proceeded to negotiate and settle the case with him, without first verifying with Lee (through his lawyers or by other means) that the Accused had authority to settle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I had also considered the Accused’s submission that Tenet Sompo had “contributed” to its own loss by making the mistake of paying the money to the Accused instead of Lee. I did not see how the Accused could be given any credit for this, especially since he had forged Lee’s signature in the very document (P2) which expressly authorised Tenet Sompo to make full payment to himself.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Next, turning to the harm caused, I was in agreement with the prosecution that the offence had impacted more than one victim in this case. In my view, besides Tenet Sompo, which was misled by the forged discharge voucher to make payment to the Accused, Lee was clearly a secondary victim of the offence as he was the one whose signature was forged in the discharge voucher, which purported to compromise his claim for damages. Indeed, it was significant to note that in his statement in P7, the Accused had admitted that he did not even inform Lee about the settlement he had reached with Tenet Sompo.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In addition, the sum of $15,000 involved was certainly not insubstantial. In this connection, I was mindful of the fact that generally, in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence: <em>PP v Gan Chai Bee Anne</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23603-SSP.xml')">[2019] 4 SLR 838</a> at [42]. At the same time, I took into consideration, in the Accused’s favour, the fact that he had made full restitution, thereby reducing the financial harm caused to Tenet Sompo.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Having examined the relevant offence-specific sentencing factors in this case, I turned to consider the offender-specific factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In this connection, I noted that the Accused could not be regarded as a first offender. In 2008, about six years before committing the present offence, he had been convicted of theft offences and sentenced to a global term of nine months’ imprisonment. In my view, the Accused’s antecedents were similar as they were property offences involving an element of dishonesty. Therefore, while they were relatively dated, they remained germane in considering the need for specific deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Indeed, the need for specific deterrence in this case was reinforced by the Accused’s conduct during the trial. I agreed with the prosecution that his fanciful claim during the defence’s case, that he was not the person present in Ms Anjalli’s office and speaking with Ms Ong Lay Gim in the recorded conversation in P5, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, evinced a lack of contrition on his part. In this regard, I also agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the payment of restitution in this case was not an indication of genuine remorse on the part of the Accused but was motivated by the hope of obtaining a lighter punishment. Thus, the restitution provided in this case, aside from reducing the harm suffered by Tenet Sompo, would be of little mitigating value: <em>Soong Hee Sin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 1 SLR(R) 0475.xml')">[2001] 1 SLR(R) 475</a> at [9].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Next, I studied the sentencing precedents put forth by parties in their submissions. The following is a summary of the sentences meted out in the respective precedents for individual charges under section 467 of the Penal Code:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"

class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Having reviewed the sentencing precedents carefully, I was in broad agreement with the prosecution’s observation that the range of sentences for a charge under section 467 of the Penal Code, involving a sum of $10,000 to $15,000 was between six to nine months’ imprisonment where the offender was untraced, had pleaded guilty, but had not made any restitution. In considering the sentencing precedents, I was well aware that the precedents cited by the parties concerned offenders who faced multiple charges, involving larger amounts of money (except perhaps in <em>Malinda</em>), and longer offending periods. However, I agreed with the prosecution that the overall criminality of the offenders in these precedents would, in the main, be reflected in the global sentences meted out by the Court, after taking into account the totality principle: <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a> at [47] to [59]. As such, to my mind, the sentences imposed on the individual charges in these precedents would still serve as useful reference points.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Taking into account the usual discount accorded to an offender who had pleaded guilty as a sign of genuine remorse, I concurred with the prosecution’s submissions that the starting sentence for an offender who had <em>claimed trial</em> to a charge involving $15,000 would be in the region of 12 months’ imprisonment. Further, balancing the remaining offence- and offender-specific sentencing considerations in this case (including the fact that the Accused was traced with similar antecedents), I provided a two-month reduction in recognition of the restitution the Accused had made to Tenet Sompo.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As such, having carefully weighed all the facts and circumstances of this case, I sentenced the Accused to 10 months’ imprisonment. In my view, this was proportionate to the Accused’s culpability and sufficient for the purpose of deterrence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Exhibit P15 relating to a warrant to arrest issued against Lee.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>In P2, the Accused’s signature was appended in black ink while Lee’s purported signature was appended in blue ink.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence (“NE”), 11 March 2020, p 50, line 23 – 29.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>See the fourth paragraph at page 2 of P7.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap4 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <iframe alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" scrolling="no" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
