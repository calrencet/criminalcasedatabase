The other two charges were offences of criminal misappropriation under section 403 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I sentenced Accused Loh to the following:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="28.58%"/> <col width="36.9%"/> <col width="34.52%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 905478/2020 </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 417 Penal Code</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 905257/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 3(1) r/w Section 10 Computer Misuse Act</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 weeks’ imprisonment</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(concurrent)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Both the Accused were dissatisfied with the sentences imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 27 February 2020, both the Accused, along with their daughter, went to the McDonalds fast food restaurant at Waterway Point shopping center, located at 83 Punggol Central, Singapore (“Waterway Point”), to have their dinner. After eating his dinner, Accused Loh told his family that he wanted to go for a walk. Accused Tay remained at the restaurant with her daughter.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     During his walk, Accused Loh found an OCBC credit card at the walkway outside McDonalds. The owner, one Seow Kit Yee Joacquim had earlier been at Waterway Point the same day and had dropped her credit card at around 8.04pm.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After finding and picking up the credit card, Accused Loh returned to his family and told Accused Tay that he had picked up a credit card. He told her that they could use it to buy things as it had a “PayWave” function and did not require a signature. Accused Tay told her husband that they should not do that. However, he assured her that nobody would find out.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the offence under Section 3(1) read with Section 10(1) of the Computer Misuse Act, Chapter 50A</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After leaving McDonalds, Accused Loh then decided to buy movie tickets for the next night using the credit card. Accused Tay agreed to this and they proceeded to the Shaw theatre located at #B2-11, Waterway Point. At the theatre, at around 8.20pm, they used a self-help kiosk that utilized an Electronic Payment System (“EPS”). Here they knowingly caused the EPS to perform the function of granting them access to the VISA payment network, without the proper authority, by using the credit card. The VISA payment network then processed the unauthorized transaction of purchasing movie tickets and food amounting to S$49.30. This was charged to the account of the owner of the credit card.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the offence under Section 417 Penal Code</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Thereafter, at around 8.38pm, the husband and wife entered a Best Denki store, located at #B1-24 of Waterway Point. There, they browsed the “Apple” products and decided to purchase a new iPhone 11 (valued at S$1149.00) for their daughter, and an iPad (valued at S$636.00) for Accused Tay, using the credit card. They decided on the specific models and informed the Best Denki staff what they wanted. The staff then issued them with a receipt and told them to proceed to the counter to make payment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Both the Accused noted that the name on the credit card was female, and as such they agreed that Accused Tay would make the payment. Accused Tay then presented the credit card to the counter staff for payment. After this, the counter staff passed a credit card slip to her to sign. Accused Tay signed on the slip, thus deceiving them into believe that she was the rightful owner of the credit card. The counter staff then passed back the credit card back to her and handed the iPhone and iPad to both the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Both the Accused had engaged in a conspiracy to cheat the sales staff of Best Denki. In pursuance of that conspiracy to cheat, Accused Tay presented the credit card to the sales staff for payment of one Apple iPad (valued at S$636.00) and one Apple iPhone 11 (valued at S$1149.00), thus in total amounting to S$1,785.00. She deceived them into believing that she was the rightful cardholder and thus authorized to make such payment, when in fact she was not. She thereby dishonestly induced them into accepting the said credit card as payment for the said items.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Subsequently, the couple proceeded to Hockhua Tonic store at #B2-30, Waterway Point. At the shop, Accused Tay presented the credit card to the store’s staff to pay for various items. However, the transaction did not go through. Hence, she paid for the items using her own credit card. Thereafter, both the Accused and their daughter left Waterway Point and returned home. Accused Loh later cut the credit card in half with a pair of scissors and disposed of it in the waste disposal chute at their residence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Both the Accused were untraced.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For both Accused, Defence Counsel submitted that when they found that there was no signature at the back of the credit card, “<em>in a moment of folly</em>”, both the Accused “<em>gave into temptation to retain the credit card and to use it for their personal benefit</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.

Given the pre-eminence and pervasiveness of credit cards as a preferred mode of payment in day-to-day commerce, such recurrent offences threaten to grievously undermine both its reliability as a mode of payment as well as the entire security of our credit infrastructure. An enormous amount of time, money and effort is unnecessarily expended by financial institutions and authorities in combating such fraud. Such offences, if left unchecked, would be akin to a slow drip of a subtle but potent poison that will inexorably and irremediably damage Singapore’s standing both as a financial hub as well as a preferred centre of commerce. Further, as a key global financial player, Singapore bears international responsibility in ensuring that it does not afford a platform for either the launch or perpetration of this genre of fraud. Financial institutions face a constant and relentless struggle each and every time a security risk posed by a credit card fraudster surfaces. Indeed, the entire credit card holding community bears the brunt, both financial and the incalculable inconvenience, whenever such an offence rears its ugly hydra head. The price of security is unstinting vigilance and the unflinching imposition of appropriately stiff sentences in dealing with transgressions.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It was reiterated in the case of <em>Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 1 SLR 0756.xml')">[2014] 1 SLR 756</a> at [48] that “<em>where the offence entails the misuse of a financial instrument or facility which threatens the conduct of legitimate commerce, the need for general deterrence takes centre stage</em>”.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Deterrence need not take the form of a custodial sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     There is no doubt that deterrence is the key sentencing consideration in this case. However, it has been acknowledged that deterrence need not always be in the form of a custodial term. In the case of <em>Public Prosecutor</em> v <em>Cheong Hock Lai</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30013-M.xml')">[2004] SGHC 122</a> at [42], the court stated:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“It is clear that a deterrent sentence need not always take the form of a custodial term.

Both these cases were cited by Defence Counsel in his plea to the court for a fine to be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Soh Puay Luan v Public Prosecutor</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The offender in <em>Soh Puay Luan</em> pleaded guilty to two charges under section 417 of the Penal Code. Three similar charges were taken into consideration. Soh used a stolen credit card on two occasions to purchase two items of jewellery valued at $5,645 and $3,500 respectively. The credit card was stolen by Soh’s boyfriend and she used it to help her boyfriend because he was in financial difficulties. Full restitution was made by Soh. The District Court imposed a 3-month imprisonment term on each of the charges, with terms to run concurrently. On appeal, the High Court set aside the imprisonment term and substituted it with a fine of $2,500 on each charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Public Prosecutor v Wuu David</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The more significant decision lay in the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Wuu David</em>. This case was discussed extensively by parties before me.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The offender in this case stole the victim’s handbag which was unattended in a bar. He took two credit cards from the handbag and threw away the handbag with its contents. He retained one credit card and passed the other credit card to a friend. Thereafter, Wuu purchased a bottle of liquor for $765 and paid for it using the stolen credit card; his friend did the same with the other stolen credit card. Thereafter, both of them threw away the credit cards in a dustbin outside the premises of the bar.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Wuu, who was untraced, pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating under section 417 of the Penal Code, with a charge of theft under section 379 taken into consideration. Full restitution was made in this case. The District Court imposed a sentence of 9 weeks’ imprisonment, On his appeal, the High Court substituted the jail term with a fine of $3,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Honourable Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong (as he then was) explained his decision. From [18]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“In my view, the present case did not involve a type of credit card abuse where the public interest required that the Appellant be punished by imprisonment. As mentioned earlier (at [7] above), the Victim and the Bar suffered no financial loss as there was full restitution by Neo and the Appellant jointly of the cost of the bottle of liquor which was consumed (ie, $765). The Appellant had a clean record with the law prior to this incident and also had a good national service record.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>However, the decisive factor that influenced my decision that a custodial sentence was inappropriate and excessive in this case consisted of two facts which were not stated in the Statement of Facts. These two facts, which were mentioned earlier (at [4]–[5] above), were that the Appellant had, after stealing the complainant’s handbag and removing the Victim’s credit cards therefrom, thrown away the handbag with the rest of its contents, and, furthermore, had, after using the Victim’s Visa card, also thrown it away…….</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>In my view, the above-mentioned facts cast a very different light on the state of mind of the Appellant at the material time. Firstly, although the Appellant was also charged (under the TIC charge) with stealing the complainant’s handbag and its contents (which included, inter alia, an “EZ-link” card, a “NTUC Link” card and an “EasiCard” issued by OCBC Bank, but no cash), he only took the Victim’s Visa card and MasterCard with the intention of using them to buy drinks. This was confirmed by his subsequent conduct. Secondly, the Appellant intended to use the stolen Visa card to make only one purchase and no more (a point which was likewise inferable from his conduct). In my view, the intention of the Appellant, as manifested by his conduct, made his act of cheating very different, in terms of the nature of the cheating and the degree of culpability involved, from the kinds of cheating (whether simple or aggravated) involving the use of misappropriated or stolen credit cards that Rajah J highlighted in Payagala ([10] supra). The Appellant’s act of cheating in the present case was akin to his having found $765 in cash in the complainant’s handbag and having used the money – as opposed to the Victim’s Visa card – to buy the same bottle of liquor. In my view, the District Judge erred in applying the sentencing benchmarks set out in Payagala to the Appellant’s cheating offence as the latter, although likewise involving the use of a stolen credit card, did not have the characteristics of the type of credit card abuse addressed in Payagala, which was held by Rajah J to warrant a custodial sentence, given the manner in and the intent with which it was committed.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In considering the case of <em>Soh Puay Luan</em> in the course of the appeal, Chan CJ stated at [16]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“I accept that Soh Puay Luan may be distinguished on the basis that the boyfriend’s influence on Soh was a valid mitigating factor, but, in my view, the public interest in deterring credit card abuse is exactly the same, whether such abuse is committed in the factual matrices of Soh Puay Luan, Payagala or the present case. What the decision in Soh Puay Luan shows is that a cheating offence under s 417 of the Penal Code which is constituted by the use of a stolen credit card </em>does not <em>necessarily entail a custodial sentence as the norm. There is always room to determine what the proper sentence should be on the facts of the particular case.”</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     What was clear from <em>Soh Puay Luan</em> and <em>Wuu David</em> was that where appropriate, a fine may be imposed in cheating offences under section 417 of the Penal Code even if it involved misuse of a credit card where public interest mattered. The case of <em>Wuu David</em> and its outcome on appeal, emphasized the important approach that the court must take in each case i.e. that each case must be assessed on its facts and on its own merits. <em>Wuu David</em> was a good reminder that in certain cases, the offence may not involve a type of credit card abuse where public interest required that the offender be punished with imprisonment; in some cases, and for one-off offenders, prosecution for the offence or offences committed will in itself provide some form of deterrence in most cases<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The custodial threshold had been crossed in this present case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     With the above principles in mind, I proceeded to consider the facts and circumstances in this case. I appreciated these following facts:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     That both the accused persons were first time offenders and pleaded guilty; they were remorseful;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     The credit card was found, not stolen;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     The period of offending involving the use of the credit card took place in less than an hour;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     There was little sophistication in the commission of the offences; the offences were not syndicated;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_e"></a>(e)     The credit card was discarded on the day itself after both the Accused persons returned home;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_f"></a>(f)     The total amount involved in the charges was relatively low, below $2,000;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_g"></a>(g)     Full restitution had been made;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_h"></a>(h)     It was in a moment of weakness that both the Accused gave in to temptation to retain the credit card and to use it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In my mind, the Accused persons were a regular couple who had gone out for dinner with their daughter at the mall, only to find a credit card which had been dropped on the walkway. In a moment of folly, they retained the credit card and used the credit card several times that same evening whilst at the mall. After they could not use it any longer and arrived home, the husband cut the credit card up and threw it away that same night. I accept the fact that the conduct of the Accused persons were more opportunistic than premeditated in the sense that they were committed without proper planning and lacked any form of sophistication; their desire for wrongful personal gain was short-lived, as opposed to it being persistent. I was certain of their contrition, both of them having made full restitution to the owner of the credit card and also pleaded guilty at earliest opportunity. For each of them, this was their first brush with the law.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, in the same consideration, these facts were outstanding:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     Even though they had retained the credit card in a “<em>moment of folly</em>” as described by Defence Counsel, there was no denying that at that moment in time, the credit card was retained by the Accused persons with a clear intention to misuse it since Accused Loh had told his wife that they could use it to buy things since it had a “PayWave” function and did not require a signature<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     The two Accused subsequently successfully used the found credit card on no less than three separate occasions, at three different merchants and attempted to use it once more at the tonic shop before the transaction failed;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     At Best Denki, both the Accused decided that Accused Tay should be the one to present the credit card for payment. This was clearly to avoid being found out, since they noticed that the name on the credit card was a female’s name;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     The amount involved in the cheating charge under section 417 of the Penal Code, even though relatively small, was not negligible.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The fact that the Accused persons in this case had used the credit card thrice at different locations before failing on the fourth transaction and thereafter cutting it up upon reaching home was to me, a significant one. This was conduct unlike the offender in <em>Wuu David</em> who had used the credit card just once before throwing it away.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The fact that the offender in <em>Wuu David</em> had removed the credit card from the victim’s handbag (before throwing the handbag and its contents away) and thereafter used the stolen credit card to make only one purchase was decisive for the appellate court. The Court was of the view that the conduct of the offender was akin to him having found $765 cash in the victim’s handbag and using the money (as opposed to the victim’s credit card) to purchase the liquor. To the Court, the act of cheating by the offender in <em>Wuu David</em> did not have the characteristics of the type of credit card abuse deserving of a custodial sentence, as envisaged in <em>Payagala</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The facts in <em>Wuu David</em> may be considered exceptional. In this present case, whilst I appreciate that the credit card was found, not stolen, the fact remained that the Accused persons had used the credit card deliberately on three separate occasions, at three different locations, to wrongfully enrich themselves. They first tried out the credit card by purchasing movie tickets and food at Shaw movie theatre worth $49.30, using a self-help kiosk, on a terminal which could process payments for purchases without the need for verification. As could be seen in a charge taken into consideration, both the Accused then proceeded to a gaming arcade where Accused Loh used the credit card to top up a “Timezone” card for $30.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     When both transactions proved successful, presumably the Accused persons were emboldened. Both of them then went to Best Denki where they picked up two “Apple” products worth a total of $1,785 – an amount significantly higher than the amounts charged to the credit card on the first two transactions. On this third occasion, it was further decided between them that Accused Tay would be the one to present the “Apple” products for purchase with the credit card since the name on the card was a female name. Whilst there may be no “<em>complex modus operandi</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> undertaken by the Accused persons in the usage of the credit card, there was a fair degree of planning which took place between them in order to avoid the detection of their offence. It was only on the fourth occasion that their continued use of the credit card was thwarted. In my view, the dishonest state of mind of the Accused persons were well-manifested by their repeated and deliberate use of the credit card, albeit within a short period of time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It should also be noted that in the cheating charge, the amount involved was a sum of $1,785. As mentioned, this amount cannot be regarded as negligible. Even without the consideration that a credit card was involved in the obtaining of wrongful gain, in the case of <em>Idya Nurhazlyn</em> at [47], the Court had this to say:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“In my judgment, a custodial sentence will generally be appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Given the facts above, I found that the present case bore a different complexion from that of <em>Wuu David</em>. The wrongful conduct of the Accused persons in relation to the use of the credit card that evening cannot be rationalised in the same manner as that of the offender in <em>Wuu David.</em> The facts did have the characteristics of the type of credit card abuse envisaged in <em>Payagala</em>. Hence, whilst I was satisfied that based on the overall facts of the case, the culpability of both the Accused may not be at the same level as the offender in <em>Payagala (</em>who took full advantage of his short transit stop to maximise his returns by embarking on a series of extravagant purchases before slipping out of jurisidction<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>), I was hard-pressed to find the facts of the case as one befitting the imposition of a fine, even a high one. They were not exceptional like in <em>Wuu David</em>, so as to warrant a departure from the imposition of a custodial term grounded on clear judicial pronouncements in offences involving the misuse of credit cards.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the majority of relevant precedents tendered by both the Prosecution and Defence in respect of cheating offences under section 417 of the Penal Code involving the use of a credit card, a custodial term appeared to be the norm. See: <em>PP</em> v <em>Goh Bing Kun; PP</em> v <em>Low Shuang Yi; PP</em> v <em>Muhammad Uzair Bin Yaacob; PP</em> v <em>Fabian Michael Chiu Toh Hui.</em> It was the same for offences under the Computer Misuse Act where a credit card was involved. None of the facts in these cases were so exceptional as to warrant the imposition of a fine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The appeal in <em>Payagala</em> was decided in the year 2007. Already then, the Court recognised the “<em>pre-eminence and pervasiveness of credit cards as a preferred mode of payment in day-to-day commerce</em>” and stressed the need for harsh custodial sentences to check the abuse of credit cards. The Court began the written judgment in <em>Payagala</em> with these observations:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“Credit cards are now widely accepted as a preferred mode of payment for daily transactions. Unfortunately, the plethora of credit card transactions has in turn engendered a multiplicity of credit card offences. The financial burden perpetrated by such credit card frauds falls on the shoulders of the issuers, the banking industry and credit card holders. Indeed, the very substantial interest that credit card issuers and banks charge for instalment payments and defaults can also be directly attributed to the substantial losses these institutions continue to chalk up from card frauds and scams. It would be no exaggeration to assert that the entire credit card holding community bears the palpable and painful brunt of such offences. In addition, the inconvenience, frustration, distress, and perhaps even loss of reputation, suffered by victims of fraud are often incalculable and irremediable”.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     13 years forward and in the year 2020 (when the offences in the current case were committed), the need for deterrence against the wrongful use of credit cards in any given situation, is even more compelling in these times. The use of credit cards is now ubiquitous, extremely wide-spread, with an even greater ease of use for payment, often without need for signature and/or any form of verification by merchants. In fact, in this case, it was precisely the “PayWave” feature of the credit card that Accused Loh knew about, which led him to assure his wife that “<em>nobody would find out</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. With low to no risk of detection and sheer convenience of use of a credit card in this current environment, like-minded individuals in the position such as the Accused persons, must be strongly deterred from using a credit card, even if found innocently in first instance. It is thus imperative that any misuse of a credit card must be dealt with by a sufficiently firm deterrent sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In this case, I was satisfied that even a high fine for both of the Accused persons would not be appropriate. The nature of the offence as well as its surrounding circumstances clearly carried the case across the custodial threshold. However, in my view, a short custodial sentence would be adequate for the Accused persons who were first-time offenders and demonstrably contrite. The imprisonment terms sought for by the Prosecution on both the section 417 Penal Code charge as well as section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act were fair and in line with precedents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On a total consideration of the facts and circumstances, as well as taking into account the mitigating features of the case, I sentenced Accused Tay to:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="28.58%"/> <col width="36.9%"/> <col width="34.52%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 905475/2020 </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 417 Penal Code</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 905260/2020</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 3(1) r/w Section 10 Computer Misuse Act</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 weeks’ imprisonment</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(concurrent)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As for Accused Loh, apart from two other cheating charges, he had two charges of criminal misappropriation taken into consideration.
