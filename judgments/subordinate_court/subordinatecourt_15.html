id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused company, CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd (UEN: 199806367G) (“<b>CPG</b>”), was convicted after trial of a charge under section 11(a) read with section 20 and punishable under section 50(<em>b</em>) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“<b>WSHA</b>”), as follows (the “<b>Charge</b>”):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">that you, from 30 April 2014 to 25 March 2015, being the occupier of SingTel Comcentre, located at 31 Exeter Road, Singapore 239732, which was a workplace within the meaning of the Workplace Safety And Health Act (Chapter 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WSHA”), did in contravention of section 11(a) of the WSHA, fail to take, so far as was reasonably practicable, such measures as were necessary to ensure that the workplace was safe and without risks to health to every person within the premises, whether or not the person was at work or was your employee; to wit, you failed to ensure that lift bin hoist LH08188N (Distinctive No. 9331T1047) was not used until a certificate of test and examination was issued by an authorised examiner certifying it safe for use, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 11(a) read with section 20 of the WSHA, and punishable under section 50(b) of the WSHA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I sentenced CPG to a fine of $120,000. This is the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The background facts as adapted from the Statement of Agreed Facts (“<b>ASOF</b>”) are as follows.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Singapore Telecommunications Limited (“<b>SingTel</b>”) is the owner of SingTel Comcentre located at 31, Exeter Road, Singapore 239732 (the “<b>premises</b>”). SingTel uses the premises for their telecommunications business. SingTel Comcentre comprised the following buildings:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Tower (a 33-storey commercial office block),</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Podium (a 5-storey part office, part telecommunication equipment block),</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     COM II (a 4-storey commercial office block),</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a>(d)     COM III (an 8-storey data centre block); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_e"></a>(e)     Orchard Exchange (a 7-storey telecommunication exchange block).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       CPG was engaged by SingTel for the provision of facilities management services at the premises. The premises (the “<b>workplace</b>”) is a “workplace” within the meaning of the WSHA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       CPG, as the occupier and managing agent of the workplace, was responsible for property administration, which included maintenance works to all common areas within the workplace. CPG also managed the sub-contractors of SingTel to ensure that they fulfilled their contractual obligations and sub- contracted works in accordance with their schedules.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Contractors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       CSP Maintenance Pte Ltd (“<b>CSP</b>”) was contracted by SingTel as a sub-contractor to provide cleaning services at the workplace. The cleaning services included the disposal of canteen waste and office refuse.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Singtel also contracted with Unimech Engineering (Pte) Ltd (“<b>Unimech</b>”) as a sub-contractor to ensure that the machinery within the workplace, which included the bin hoists, were serviced on time and properly maintained so that they could operate safely. Unimech also provided <em>ad hoc</em> repairs for any machinery breakdown within the workplace. Unimech’s work scope included sourcing for an Authorised Examiner (“<b>AE</b>”) to examine and certify the bin hoists at the workplace to be safe for use. Unimech provided reports on inspection, servicing and maintenance of bin hoist equipment, and copies of the certification of test and examination by an AE to CPG.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Incident</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Charge arose from a workplace incident on 25 March 2015 at 4.05 pm (the “<b>Incident</b>”) involving lift bin hoist LH08188N (Distinctive No. 9331T1047) (the “<b>Hoist</b>”) located at the COM III Bin Centre, which resulted in the death of a CSP employee, one Mr Mak Weng Yeow (“<b>the Deceased</b>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Deceased was employed by CSP as a cleaner and was tasked to perform refuse disposal works at COM III. At the material time, the Deceased was taking rubbish bulk bins for the collection of office refuse out from the Hoist at level one of COM III Bin Centre. His colleague, one Mark Kalaivanan S/O Tamilarasan (“<b>Mark</b>”), a fellow cleaner from CSP, was collecting empty bulk bins from basement 1 of the bin centre, loading them into the Hoist, and causing the Hoist to ascend to level 1, where the Deceased would then unload the bulk bins from the Hoist.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At around 4.05 pm, Mark was ready to load more bulk bins into the Hoist. He pressed the control button to activate the lift cage to descend from level 1 to the basement level. However, the Hoist did not descend to the basement level. At about the same time, Mark heard some groaning from upstairs. Mark ran upstairs and saw the Deceased trapped between the lift cage and the lift landing platform. The Deceased was believed to have been exiting the lift bin at level one of the bin centre with the bulk bins when Mark activated the lift cage, and was trapped when the lift cage started descending. The Deceased was crushed between the lift landing at level 1 and the top of the lift cage. He was pronounced dead by attending paramedics at the scene, with the certified cause of death being multiple injuries.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Cause of the Incident</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Investigations revealed that the cause of the accident was a faulty safety interlock mechanism of the cargo lift system, which allowed the Hoist to move up and down despite the limit switches of the Hoist being faulty or missing. Limit switches are safety devices that prevented the Hoist from moving unless all the doors were closed. Forensic engineering assessment found that the limit switch on the lift landing on level one was faulty, while the limit switch on the basement level was missing. The faulty limit switches were discovered as early as on 17 December 2014 during two service inspections by Unimech but were not promptly rectified and replaced.

CPG representatives’ testimony at trial was that by reason of these communications from Unimech, they were given to understand that the AE Examiner did come for the AE Inspection as represented by Phyu, that the Hoist passed the AE Inspection, and that a valid AEC had been issued by the AE Examiner which was in the process of being dispatched to Singtel and CPG. Consistent with their belief, CPG chased Unimech for the renewed certificate via emails on no less than 11 occasions, namely on 12 May 2014, 20 May 2014, 21 May 2014, 30 June 2014, 8 July 2014, 16 July 2014, 29 July 2014, 7 August 2014, 27 September 2014, 10 October 2014 and 18 November 2014<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. Unimech’s response was consistently to omit to reply to these chasers, and at any rate, to deliberately fail to mention to CPG that no AE inspection had in fact taken place on 30 April 2014, and that there was really no AEC to send over. In some instances, Unimech representatives even “committed” to CPG that they would send over the AEC, hence engendering the impression that the AEC had been renewed, only to fail to do so<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Unbeknownst to CPG, contrary to Unimech’s representations, no AE came down for the AE Inspection on 30 April 2014, and indeed for the period from 30 April 2014 to 30 November 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">AE Inspection due on 30 October 2014</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Had the renewal of the AEC on 30 April 2014 been carried out, the next renewal of the AEC for the Hoist would have been due six months later, on 30 October 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The records show that CPG sent an email to Unimech on 10 October 2014<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> reminding Unimech to follow up with the renewal of the AEC which was ‘due to expire’ on 30 October 2014.

As it turned out, it was only on 1 December 2014, that Chang Choong Meng (PW7) (“<b>AE Chang</b>”), an AE, was engaged by Unimech to carry out the AE inspection and certify that the lifting equipment at the workplace to be safe for use.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     AE Chang conducted an examination on the Hoist in the presence of Unimech’s technicians.

AE Chang refused to certify the Hoist as safe for use, pending the rectification of the faulty limit switches.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Not knowing that AE Chang had in fact refused to certify the Hoist until the specified repair works were carried, after 1 December 2014, CPG asked Unimech for the renewed AEC via emails on 11 February 2015, 9 March 2015 and 18 March 2015<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.

The salient paragraphs of Unimech’s SOF are reproduced below:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[27] Following the examination by AE Chang on the hoist, Ho [a Unimech technician] put up a service report to CPG and Unimech (Service Report No. 3849-14) that stated “defect found limit switch need to replace 2 pcs (<em>sic</em>)” and recommended “to rectify faulty safety devices for roller doors”. <em>There was no recommendation or instruction to stop the operation of the hoist made on the same service report.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[28]  Following the AE examination on 1 December 2014, CPG asked Unimech for the renewed certificate via emails on 11 February 2015, 9 March 2015 and 18 March 2015. <em>In its responses to CPG’s emails, Unimech made no mention that AE Chang had refused to certify the hoist to be safe for use, following his examination on 1 December 2014</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[29].  <em>Despite knowing the AE Chang refused to certify the hoist to be safe for use, [Unimech] did not inform CPG nor Singtel that there was no valid certificate</em> under r19(1) GP Regs for the operation of the hoist. <em>[Unimech] also took no steps to inform CPG or Singtel to stop the operation of the hoist and that it was unsafe to continue the operation of the hoist until the recertification</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[30]  The hoist operated <em>at all material times from 30 April 2014 to 25 March 2015.</em> At all material times, <em>[Unimech] did not inform CPG to stop operation of the hoist despite knowing that the hoist did not have a valid certificate certifying the hoist safe for use</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">……..</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[33]  Investigations revealed that while [Unimech]’s service reports to CPG contained a standard line that states “the client was informed of the found defects (if any) and the danger resulting there from the continuous use of the equipment”, <em>[Unimech] only indicated faults it discovered in its service reports to CPG but did not inform CPG of the nature of the risks that could arise when operating the hoist without a certificate, certifying it safe for use, nor of the nature of the risks that could arise when operating the hoist with faulty or defective limit switches.” (emphasis added)</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Thus, from 30 April 2014 to 25 March 2015 (the date of the Incident), the hoist continued in operation without a valid AEC.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings against Unimech</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Three parties were initially charged under the WSHA as a result of the Incident, namely CSP, Unimech and CPG.

The charges against CSP were eventually not proceeded with, and CSP was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal sometime in 2018.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The trial was originally scheduled as a joint trial involving CPG and Unimech. Prior to commencement of the joint trial on 23 September 2019, Unimech pleaded guilty (“<b>PG</b>”) to an amended charge under Section 12(2) read with Section 20 of the WSHA. Unimech was convicted of the charge and sentenced to a fine of $160,000. The trial thereafter proceeded as against CPG solely.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings at the conclusion of CPG’s trial </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings of Fact</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At the end of a 22-day trial, and after hearing from nine Prosecution witnesses and one Defence witness, I convicted CPG of the Charge. I made the following findings:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     CPG had, for the most part, actively monitored the renewal of the AECs as the Managing Agent of the workplace. To that end, the evidence suggested that CPG had sent multiple reminders to Unimech to renew the AECs before their expiry dates<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. It also followed up with numerous chasers to Unimech to forward a copy of the renewed AECs to CPG for monitoring purposes<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     Unimech had, over an extended period of time, failed to inform CPG that the AECs had not in fact been issued by the relevant AE, and <em>had in fact misled</em> CPG into believing that AECs were issued in respect of the 6-month periods with effect from 30 April 2014 and 30 October 2014 respectively. It was further admitted by Unimech in its PG proceedings that it took no steps to inform CPG to stop the operation of the hoist, or that it was unsafe to continue with its operation until re-certification was completed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     Despite CPG’s efforts at sending numerous phone/email chasers to Unimech, CPG never in fact received the relevant AECs. Apart from chasing Unimech personnel repeatedly for these certificates, CPG did not take more proactive steps, such as stopping the usage of the accident hoist in the interest of safety.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     Apart from chasing Unimech, CPG also did not carry out any independent enquires of its own - either internally within its staff (e.g. enquires made with the Fire Command Centre) or with other external parties (e.g. directly with the AEs) - to ascertain if the relevant AE inspections did take place without issue. The Hoist eventually failed to undergo and pass not one, but two, rounds of AE certification before the accident happened, without CPG being aware of this.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">CPG’s breach of section 11(a) WSHA</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Against this backdrop, I found that CPG breached its duty as occupier by failing to take all reasonably practicable measures to ensure that there was a valid AEC in respect of the accident hoist for the six-month periods commencing 30 April 2014 and 30 October 2014 respectively, and in failing to shut down the accident hoist when CPG could not be certain that a valid AEC was in place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I found that CPG’s breach of its duty under section 11(a) WSHA lay in its allowing the Hoist to continue in operation <em>when it did not know for a fact that the Hoist had a valid AEC</em>. Despite CPG’s arguments that they lacked the technical expertise and could not have known that the Hoist was unsafe for operation unless Unimech advised them accordingly, I found that CPG’s duty was to ensure that the Hoist was certified safe for use by an independent AE, <em>as confirmed by the receipt of a validly issued AEC</em>. This was a largely administrative task that CPG was fully competent to perform.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I further found that it was insufficient for CPG to merely rely on the assurances and/or representations from Unimech that the Hoist was safe for use. The scheme of the WSHA and regulation 19 of the GP Regs expressly contemplated that reliance on the representations of a specialist contractor, here Unimech, was insufficient to discharge the occupier’s duty to ensure that the equipment is safe for usage. The occupier must, in addition, ensure that the lifts and hoists are certified safe for use by an independent professional, the AE, on a periodic basis by way of a second level check. CPG was not allowed under the legislative scheme of the WSHA to substitute the AE’s opinion as to the safety of the accident hoist with the opinions and/or assurances from Unimech.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasonably practicable measures CPG could have undertaken</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I found that some of the reasonably practicable measures which CPG could have taken to ensure that the requisite safety standards under the WSHA were met included the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     While CPG had sent repeated chasers to Unimech for copies of the AECs, it should have followed through with its requests until a copy of the AEC was in fact received by CPG. When copies of the AEC were not forthcoming despite repeated chasers and promises from Unimech, CPG ought to have thoroughly investigated the reasons for Unimech’s failure to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     Apart from chasing for the certificates and relying on Unimech’s assurances, CPG should have carried out independent verifications of its own to ascertain if the AE inspections were in fact carried out and successfully completed. That CPG did not independently investigate was borne out by the fact that CPG was completely unaware that no AE came down for the scheduled AE inspection on 30 April 2014, contrary to Unimech’s representations. This was despite the fact that all service contractors to the premises (including an appointed AE) were required to sign in at the Fire Command Centre (FCC) which was under CPG’s charge, as Managing Agent of the premises. An AE would further be escorted by CPG staff to the worksites where inspections were required to be done. Had some of these independent checks been carried out – such as a check of the relevant FCC entry-exit records, as well as enquiries made of the internal escorting staff – this would have alerted CPG to the fact that no AE inspection in fact took place on 30 April 2014. The failure to carry out these checks caused CPG to continue to be misled by Unimech.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     In relation to the 1 December 2014 AE inspection by AE Chang, CPG ought to have paid especial attention to it as the inspection was already overdue by a month by then (the expiry date of the last inspection cycle being 30 October 2014). Yet, by CPG’s own testimony, it did not have a CPG technician present at the AE inspection. Having a Managing Agent’s (i.e. CPG) representative present at the inspection was a reasonably practicable step which CPG could and ought to have taken, and which further accorded with industry practice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. As no CPG representative was present at the 1 December 2014 AE inspection, the AE’s comments that the AEC would not be issued pending the completion of various repair works (including the faulty limit switches) was not picked up by CPG.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     That CPG should pay special attention to the status of the issuance of the AECs following the 1 December 2014 inspection was accentuated by the fact that the service report issued by Unimech on 1 December 2014 contained a clear recommendation to rectify faulty safety devices in the roller doors. CPG’s Mark Cruz (PW5) testified that he consequently chased for the repair quotations from Unimech. However, up to the date of the accident (25 March 2015), close to four months after the 1 December 2014 inspection, a copy of the AEC certificate was still not received by CPG. In the meantime, PW5 gave no directions to stop the usage of the Hoist as “Unimech did not advise [them to do] so”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_e"></a>(e)     I further found that it was always open and prudent for CPG to have checked with the relevant AE whether the Hoist had in fact passed the AE inspection when receipt of the certificates was persistently delayed. While the AE was engaged by Unimech, there was nothing to prohibit CPG from approaching the AE directly for an update on the status of the AE inspection.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_f"></a>(f)     Given Unimech’s persistent failure in providing copies of the AECs, CPG, as a specialist Managing Agent, should have escalated the issue to Singtel and recommended the shutting down of the accident hoist until it could establish with certainty that the AECs were in fact issued. This is particularly so in light of the requirements of regulation 19(3) GP Regs.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_g"></a>(g)     It was in any event reasonably practicable to shut down the Hoist. It was not disputed that in determining what constitutes a “reasonably practicable” measure, a comparison must be made between the quantum of risk posed and the extent of sacrifice required to implement the mitigative measure in question, and whether there is a gross disproportion between the two: see <em>Edwards v National Coal Board</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/61115-E-M.xml')">[1949] 1 KB 704</a> at 714 (“<em>Edwards v National Coal Board”)</em>, cited in <em>Public Prosecutor v MW Group Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21672-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 110</a>. Here, the Hoist was used for transportation of rubbish by a limited number of cleaners. There were further alternate means of transporting the rubbish bins from the basement level to the first level (albeit less conveniently). Balancing the potential risks of allowing cleaners to manually load and unload the rubbish bins into and from an unsafe hoist, which carried it clearly foreseeable risk of injury to the workers in the event of a safety device malfunction, against the inconvenience occasioned by the shutting down of the Hoist until the AECs were confirmed to have been received, the sacrifice required could not be said to be grossly disproportionate to the risk of allowing the Hoist to stay in operation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In summary, I found that CPG’s conduct during the material period was marked by excessive reliance on Unimech, with little or no attempts being made by CPG to independently verify if the Hoist had in fact been certified and passed the AE certification tests required under law. Various reasonably practical measures as outlined above could have been taken by CPG, but were not. Had CPG implemented these measures, they would have discovered, as early as on 30 April 2014, that the Hoist was being operated in contravention of the safety requirements mandated under section 11 WSHA and regulation 19 of the GP Regs. I therefore find that the Prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that CPG has breached its duty as occupier under section 11(a) of the WSHA.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">SENTENCE</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Submissions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Prosecution submitted that CPG ought to be sentenced to a fine of at least $300,000 in the present case. It argued that the level of harm which resulted from these breaches was “clearly [at the] higher end of the high category”, and CPG’s level of culpability was at the “boundary between [the] moderate and high category”. The $300,000 fine was based on a new sentencing framework for sections 11 and 12 WSHA offences proposed by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The existing sentencing frameworks</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Prosecution rightly noted that there are two recent guideline judgements from the High Court that set out sentencing frameworks for offences involving breaches of duties under section 20 read with section 12(1) of the WSHA, namely, <em>MW Group Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23267-SSP.xml')">[2019] 3 SLR 1300</a> (“<b><em>MW Group</em></b>”) and <em>Public Prosecutor v GSE &amp; Construction Corp</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20217-SSP.xml')">[2017] 3 SLR 682</a> (“<b><em>GSE</em></b>”). In the present case, CPG had similarly committed an offence of breaching duties under the WSHA, albeit under s11(a) WSHA. Given the significant similarities in the language of s11(a) and section 12 WSHA, it was not seriously contested that the general principles from <em>MW Group</em> and <em>GSE</em> could apply to the offences involving a breach of duties under section 20 read with section 11(a) WSHA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Both <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> set out a similar two-step sentencing frameworks. In the first stage of the inquiry, the Court determines the indicative starting point sentence based on two factual elements, namely, (i) the <em>potential harm caused by the offence</em>, and (ii) the <em>culpability of the offender</em>. In the second stage of the inquiry, the Court calibrates the sentence derived in the first stage to factor in the aggravating or mitigating factors. The non-exhaustive list of aggravating and mitigating factors that the sentencing Court can consider at the second stage of the inquiry are set out on <em>MW Group</em> at [60-61]; and <em>GSE</em> at [77(e), (f)]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The harm-culpability matrix laid down by <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> for the first stage of the enquiry, in cases where the

class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I did not understand the Prosecution as contending that the <em>GSE</em> and the <em>MW Group</em> frameworks were inconsistent with each other, the latter being a mere refinement of the former. Prosecution, however, submitted that a new sentencing framework (“<b>ASF</b>”) for prosecutions under sections 11 and 12 of the WSHA, which departs from that set out in <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em>, should be pronounced by this court. The basis of Prosecution’s submissions is the latest High Court decision of <em>Mao Xuezhong v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24538-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 99</a> (“<b><em>Mao Xuezhong</em></b>”), which sets out a sentencing framework for prosecutions brought under section 15(3A) of the WSHA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In laying out a new section 15(3A) sentencing framework, the three-judge High Court coram in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> expressly departed from the mathematical approach adopted by the High Court in another decision touching on section 15(3A) WSHA, namely <em>Nurun Novi Saydur Rahman v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22956-SSP.xml')">[2019] 3 SLR 413</a> (“<b><em>Nurun Novi</em></b>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Despite the fact that <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> was dealing with a different provision of the WSHA, Prosecution submits that there are “clear conceptual differences” between the <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> frameworks on one hand, and the framework set out by the High Court in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> on the other. Prosecution pointed out the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whereas the harm-culpability matrix in the <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> frameworks are based on <em>potential harm</em> and culpability, by contrast, the framework set out in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> is based on harm (<em>both actual and potential</em>) and culpability (see <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> at [64]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     In relation to actual harm, the High Court in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> further stated that the harm should be graded near the top end of the high range, for the purposes of stage 1 of the inquiry, if death or serious injury occurred. In contrast, under the <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW</em> Group frameworks, the fact that death resulted was to be treated as an aggravating factor under stage 2 of the enquiry.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     Under the <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> frameworks, more weight is given to potential harm as opposed to culpability, with actual harm being treated as an aggravating factor. Under the <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> framework, equal weight is to be given to both harm and culpability (see <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> at [67]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Prosecution submits that the conceptual differences underpinning the <em>GSE/MW Group</em> frameworks on one hand, and the <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> framework on the other, “cannot be reconciled as a matter of principle”. A new sentencing framework for section 11 and section 12 WSHA offences should therefore be pronounced by this court given the decision of the superior bench in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em>. The new sentencing framework proposed by the Prosecution for offences under section 12 p/u section 50(b) of the WSHA is as follows:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="19.9791728652187%"/> <col width="19.9940493900625%"/> <col width="20.0089259149063%"/> <col width="20.0089259149063%"/> <col width="20.0089259149063%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="b" colspan="5" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b><em>Alternate Sentencing framework for offences under s 12 p/u 50(b) WSHA</em></b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Culpability</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Low</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Moderate</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>High</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Harm</b> </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>(Actual and Potential)</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>High</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150,000 to $225,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$225,000 to $300,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$300,000 to $500,000</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Moderate</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$75,000 to $150,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150,000 to $225,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$225,000 to $300,000</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Low</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to $75,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$75,000 to $150,000</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150,000 to $225,000</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the ASF to the facts of the case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On the level of <em>harm</em>, Prosecution submits that the present case should be pegged at the upper high end. The <em>actual harm</em> in this case involved the death of a worker. There was further a clear contributory link between the death caused and CPG’s breach in ensuring there was a valid AEC certifying the Hoist safe for usage. The degree of <em>potential harm</em> was also high as CPG had allowed the Hoist to remain in operation when it did not know for a fact if there was a valid AEC in place. The likelihood of harm was also high given the substantial period (close to a year) when the Hoist continued in operation without an AEC.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On the level of culpability, Prosecution pegged it at the boundary of the moderate and high category, referencing the numerous measures which this court had earlier identified as reasonably practicable steps which CPG could have undertaken to ensure the safety of the workplace: see paragraphs [32(a) to (g)] above. Prosecution also suggested that the breach was systemic in nature as there were other equipment that were found to be without valid AECs arising from the 1 December 2014 inspection. Finally, Prosecution submits that CPG’s act of failing to stop the usage of the Hoist was a rash one.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Based on the forgoing, Prosecution submits that the present case fell within (i) the upper end of the high harm category; and (ii) at the boundary between moderate and high culpability category. This attracts a sentencing range of $300,000 to $500,000 under the ASF for claim-trial cases. Prosecution submits that an appropriate starting point is a fine of at least $300,000. As there were no real mitigating factors in the present case, the appropriate sentence in the present case should therefore be a fine of at least $300,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Defence, on the other hand, submitted for a low fine of $50,000. The key arguments made by the Defence are as follows.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The ASF should not be pronounced in the present case </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     First, the Defence argued that the proposed adoption of the ASF based on <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> was misguided. Counsel pointed out that both <em>GSE, MW Group</em> and <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> are High Court decisions. According to the Defence, the Prosecution has not provided cogent reasons for preferring the framework in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> over the other two High Court decisions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Secondly, whereas the frameworks in <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> were formulated specifically in relation to offences under section 12 of the WSHA, the framework in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> was formulated with offences under section 15(3A) of the WSHA in mind. Section 15(3A) WSHA, at is core, is fundamentally different from Sections 11 and 12 of the WSHA, both in terms the applicable standards for establishing liability and the underlying legislative purpose. Notably, while the High Court in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> expressly did not endorse the <em>Nurun Novi</em> sentencing framework for offences under <em>section 15(3A)</em> of the WSHA, no such rejection was made with respect to the sentencing framework in <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> for offences under section 12 of the WSHA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Thirdly, it was undisputed that Unimech was sentenced under the <em>MW Group</em> sentencing framework, and was ultimately sentenced to a fine of $160,000. By submitting for this court to sentence CPG under the ASF, “serious and demonstrable injustice” would be caused to CPG. CPG would be sentenced under completely different and harsher sentencing framework. It is inconceivable for CPG, which is undisputedly the less culpable party involved in the Incident, should be prejudiced and punished more severely than Unimech. Such an outcome flies in the face of the principle of parity.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Fourthly, even if this court were minded to adopt the ASF proposed by the Prosecution, Defence Counsel argued that the doctrine of prospective overruling should be invoked.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence’s application of the MW Group framework to the present case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The overall submission of the Defence is that CPG should be sentenced under the <em>MW Group</em> framework, consistent with Unimech’s sentencing. Defence submits that the following factors are relevant to the assessment of the CPG’s <em>culpability</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     CPG’s breach of duty arose only because CPG had been persistently misled by Unimech into believing that the AECs for the Hoist had been issued in respect of the six-month periods with effect from 30 April 2014 and 30 December 2014 respectively.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     CPG’s breach was purely administrative. Critically, it was undisputed that CPG had, for the most part, actively monitored the renewal of the AECs for the Hoist, and had on many occasions, over an extended period of time, chased Unimech for copies of the AECs.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     It is apparent from the particulars of CPG and Unimech’s charges that Unimech was by far the more culpable party, both in terms of the nature <em>and</em> number of breaches preferred against the respective parties. Unimech had pleaded guilty to breaches of <em>multiple</em> duties as an employer by failing to take reasonably practicable measures that were necessary to ensure the safety and health of persons (not being its employees) in the workplace. CPG, on the other hand, was only liable for a single breach that was administrative in nature, i.e. failing to ensure that a valid AEC had been procured by Unimech and was in place when the Hoist was allowed to remain in operation;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     CPG’s scope of duty as occupier in relation to the Hoist was also much narrower and limited as compared to Unimech. In particular, CPG was entitled to rely on Unimech, the specialist contractor engaged by Singtel, to ensure that: (i) the Hoist was maintained in safe condition and that any unsafe conditions were rectified; (ii) the Hoist would be inspected by an AE at least once every 6 months, (iii) CPG would be informed by Unimech of any person at the workplace who may be exposed to risks to safety in relation to the Hoist, and (iv) CPG would be informed by Unimech to stop the operation of the Hoist, or that it was unsafe to continue with its operation until the AECs were issued. Consequently, CPG’s breach was far less severe in nature and degree as compared to Unimech’s breaches under the WSHA.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     Unlike Unimech, CPG was conscientious and diligent in taking steps to comply with its obligation under the WSHA, although its conduct was found by this Court to have fallen short of the duty required of it as an occupier. Indeed, where the AE inspections were concerned, Unimech was the party that had the primary duty to source for an AE to examine and certify that the Hoist was safe for use, to inform CPG of the outcome of such inspections, to obtain the AECs from the AE and to furnish a soft copy to CPG.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Turning to the assessment of <em>potential for harm</em>, Defence counsel submitted that the potential harm involved in CPG’s conduct ought to be regarded as being at the lower end of medium band for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     The seriousness of harm risked is low. There is nothing inherently dangerous in permitting the operation of the Hoist without ascertaining that valid AECs were issued, especially as the Defendant had ensured that the Hoist was serviced and maintained regularly to ensure its safe operation.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     The likelihood of the harm from the Defendant’s breach is also low as several safety measures and standard operating procedures have been put in place to mitigate the risk of harm. It was further undisputed that the Hoist was designed to transport rubbish bulk bins, and not human passengers.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     The number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of the harm was low. In the present case, the only users of the Hoists were the cleaners who were tasked to transport rubbish bins at the Com III Bin Centre. The actual number of people exposed to the risk would be the users of the Hoist at any one time, i.e. one person.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For all these reasons, Defence submitted that CPG’s liability fell within: (i) the lower end of the low culpability band; and (ii) the lower end of the medium potential for harm band. Based on the <em>MW Group</em> Framework, this should attract an indicative starting sentencing point of $65,000. In view of the various mitigating factors - in particular, CPG’s cooperation with the authorities, prompt taking of remedial steps to remedy the breach and preventing similar breaches, absence of antecedents and its adoption of effective health and safety procedures – the final sentence should be adjusted downwards to $50,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     After carefully considering the submission of both parties, I declined to adopt the ASF proposed by the Prosecution. I followed instead the <em>MW Group</em> sentencing framework used in Unimech’s sentencing in the related PG Proceedings, and sentenced CPG to a fine of $120,000. I set out the ground of my decision below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Principles of Stare Decisis</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     First, a lower court is not entitled to disregard the guidance given by established sentencing precedents set by the High Court - see <em>Public Prosecutor v UI</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0500.xml')">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500</a> (CA). <em>Mao Xuezhong, GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> are all High Court decisions which are binding to the same extent on this court. <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> does not expressly overrule <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em>. Indeed it cannot, as all three are High Court decisions. When faced with conflicting High Court decisions, the role of the lower court is to adopt the case that is most applicable to the facts of the case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevance of subject matter</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I therefore turn to the WSHA provisions dealt with by the High Court in each of the three decisions. For ease of reference, Section 11(a) of the WSHA (the provision engaged in the present case), Section 12 of the WSHA (the provision dealt with in <em>GSE and MW Group</em>), and Section 15(3A) of the WSHA (the provision dealt with in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em>) are reproduced below:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Section 11(a) of the WSHA</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11. — It shall be the duty of every <em>occupier</em> of any workplace <em>to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, such measures</em> to ensure that … (a) the workplace … are safe and without risks to health to every person within those premises, whether or not the person is at work or is an employee of the occupier. (<em>emphasis added</em>)</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Section 12 of the WSHA</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.—(1) It shall be the duty of every <em>employer to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, such measures as are necessary</em> to ensure the safety and health of his employees at work. (<em>emphasis added</em>)</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Section 15(3A) of the WSHA</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.—(3A) <em>Any person at work who</em>, without reasonable cause, <em>does any </em><b><em>negligent act </em></b><em>which endangers the safety or health</em> of himself or others shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding $30,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. <em>(emphasis added)</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As noted above, <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> sets out a sentencing framework for section 15(3A) WSHA, which is materially different from section 12 of the WSHA, the provision addressed by the High Court in the decisions of <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em>. The present case involves a contravention of section 11 WSHA, which is <em>worded in similar fashion</em> to section 12. Like section 12 WSHA, section 11 requires the occupier or employer (as the case may be) <em>to take “</em><em><u>reasonably practicable </u></em><em>measures”</em> to ensure the safety and health of the employees or workplace. What constitutes “reasonably practicable” measures is ascertained by reference to the test in <em>Edwards v National Coal Board:</em> see paragraph [32(g)] above. Section 15(3A) WSHA, on the other hand, imports a test of negligence, requiring persons <em>at work not to undertake </em><em><u>negligent </u></em><em>acts</em> which endanger the safety of himself or others. The yardsticks for establishing liability under the two sets of provisions are, on their face, very different.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Furthermore, the <em>conduct criminalized</em> under section 15(3A) is also significantly different from that criminalized under sections 11 and 12 WSHA. Whereas sections 11 and 12 WSHA criminalize <em>failures</em> by persons or entities <em>with overall control and oversight</em> over the workplace or employees in ensuring the safety and health risks of such workplace (i.e. acts of <em>omission</em>), section 15(3A) WSHA criminalizes <em>negligent conduct committed by individuals (i.e. a “person at work”)</em> working at the workplace (i.e. acts of <em>commission</em>). Viewed in this light, the mischief targeted under the two sets of provisions are again markedly different.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     That the specific mischiefs sought to be addressed by sections 11 and 12 WSHA and section 15(3A) WSHA are different is also borne out by the prescribed punishment for a breach of each of the provisions. The punishment for breach of section 11 or 12 WSHA (in the case of a natural person) is a fine not exceeding <em>$200,000</em> or a maximum of 2 years imprisonment or both: see section 50(a) WSHA. A breach of section 15(3A) WSHA, on the other hand, attracts a significantly lesser fine not exceeding <em>$30,000</em> or a maximum of 2 years imprisonment, or both. Section 15(3A) WSHA, literally construed, further applies only to individuals (viz, a “person at work”) and not body corporates. Indeed, no prescribed punishment for body corporates is expressly provided for in section 15(3A) WSHA; cf. section 50(b) WSHA which applies to sections 11 and 12 WSHA offences. Cumulatively, these factors suggest to me that the <em>specific</em> mischief (within the scheme of the WSHA) sought to be addressed under sections 11 and 12 WSHA on the one hand, and section 15(3A) WSHA on the other, are different in material respects. Viewed in this light, the High Court cases of <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em>, which deal with a legislative provision that is more similar to that encountered in the present case, would have significantly greater precedential value than the High Court decision in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> for present purposes.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Parity Principle</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     A further important consideration I had regard to was the parity principle. This principle was summed up by the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18572-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 25</a> in the following terms:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[1]   <em>Consistency in sentencing is a key principle in our criminal justice system</em>. ..… The principle of parity in sentencing between co-offenders urges that <em>sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other. To put it simply, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished</em>…….</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[47] ….. <em>The crucial consideration in considering the application of the parity principle is</em> not whether the accused feels aggrieved that a co-accused person has been treated more leniently, but <em>whether the public, with knowledge of the various sentences, would perceive that the appellant had suffered injustice</em> …. <em>[I]t is useful to understand that the parity principle ultimately rests on the need to preserve and protect public confidence in the administration of justice. Public confidence in this context demands that sentencing is carried out with due regard to the element of basic fairness. Where this is not the case, and where co-offenders in a common criminal enterprise are sentenced in an unduly disparate manner, the sentences would then seem to be arbitrarily imposed and this raises fundamental rule of law concerns</em>.” <em>[emphasis added]</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It is not disputed that Unimech was sentenced under <em>MW Group</em> framework<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. It was further not disputed that CPG’s breach and Unimech’s breach arose out of the same factual matrix and incident. Sentencing parity therefore requires that the sentences meted out to Unimech and CPG should not be unduly disparate based on their respective blameworthiness.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In this regard, the materials and evidence presented before this court all pointed to Unimech being the significantly more culpable party. Among other things, four particulars of breach were included in the charge against Unimech, namely: (i) failing to maintain the accident hoist in a safe condition; (ii) failing to ensure that the accident hoist was inspected by an AE; (iii) failing to ensure that the hoist was not used unless there is a valid AEC, and (iv) failing to ensure that persons in the workplace who may be exposed to risks are informed of the nature of the risks. In contrast, the charge against CPG only itemizes one particular of breach; i.e. item (iii). Both entities were eventually convicted of the respective charge(s) against them (whether by PG or after a full trial). The <em>number and nature</em> of the alleged breaches against Unimech support the inference that the conduct of Unimech was by far more blameworthy.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Unimech’s higher culpability was further underscored by the facts of the case. Unimech’s breach of duty included its failure to procure the AEC (which fell squarely within its contractual duty to SingTel), its failure to inform CPG that there was no valid AEC in place at the material time, and its deliberate misrepresentations to CPG that the AECs have been obtained and are being sent to CPG: see paragraph [34] above<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. CPG’s fault, on the other hand, laid in its placing excessive reliance on Unimech, and in its omission to take independent steps to verify for itself whether valid AECs had in fact been issued.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As the specialist contractor in charge of the repair and maintenance of the hoist, Unimech would be more familiar with the safety risks associated with the operation of a hoist with defective limit switches compared to CPG. Comparatively, CPG, as Managing Agent, would necessarily possess less technical expertise to appreciate the associated risks, unless specifically advised by Unimech, which was not done in the present case: see paragraph [24] above<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. Viewed from a different angle, CPG’s breach is also less proximately related to the accident, compared to Unimech’s.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     All things considered, I found that Unimech was clearly the more culpable party. As I would illustrate below, the net effect of adopting the ASF, however, is that CPG would receive a sentence that is unduly harsh relative to its blameworthiness <em>vis-a-vis</em> Unimech, contrary to the parity principle. In this connection, it is apposite to note the observations made by the Court of Appeal in <em>Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22201-SSP.xml')">[2018] 2 SLR 557</a> (albeit in the context of prospective overruling), namely that when sentencing an offender, the court must be concerned “to avoid serious and demonstrable injustice to the offender at hand, whose case was arbitrarily selected for the calibration of the new sentencing framework” (at [58]). Thus, <em>even if</em> the sentencing frameworks in <em>GSE</em> and <em>MW Group</em> are due for review (as Prosecution submits), this, in my respectful opinion, is <em>not</em> the appropriate case to undertake such a review, having regard to the fact that the co-accused had already been sentenced under a preexisting, established sentencing framework. For all these reasons, I declined to adopt the ASF.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing framework adopted in the present case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I have explained why I did not find <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> to be a directly relevant precedent for present purposes, and why I declined to adopt the ASF. Instead, I found the cases of <em>MW Group</em> and <em>GSE</em> to be binding and authoritative precedents which should inform the sentencing in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Further, in line with the approach adopted in Unimech’s sentencing, I found it appropriate to adopt the sentencing framework laid down in <em>MW Group</em>. Specifically, I followed the tabular format of the sentencing benchmark outlined in <em>MW Group</em> (at [50]) and not the “sentence scale” graph approach set out at [39] of <em>MW Group</em>. The <em>MW Group</em> sentencing table is, in my view, preferred given: (i) it appeared to be the framework adopted by the sentencing judge when sentencing Unimech in the related PG proceedings; and (ii) it eschews an overly mathematical approach associated with the sentence scale graph which was frowned upon by the court of three judges in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em> [at 62(b)].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     For ease of reference, I set out below the Culpability-Harm matrix decided in Unimech’s sentencing, that advocated by Prosecution and the Defence in the present case, and my conclusion on the extent of potential harm/culpability in the present case, as follows:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"> <colgroup> <col width="18.4763047390522%"/> <col width="18.5162967406519%"/> <col width="20.3959208158368%"/> <col width="20.375924815037%"/> <col width="22.2355528894221%"/> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Unimech</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Prosecution</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Defence</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>My decision</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Culpability</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">High (mid-point)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Medium (high end)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Low (Low end)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Medium (low end)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Potential Harm</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Medium (high end)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">High (high end)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Medium (low end)</p> </td> <td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Medium (mid end)</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br clear="left"/> <br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Culpability</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I have classified CPG’s culpability under the <u>Medium category (low end)</u> applying the factors set out in [28] of <em>MW Group</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_a"></a>(a)      <u>No. of breaches.</u> The charge against CPG only particularized one breach, namely the failure by CPG to ensure that the Hoist operated whilst having a valid AEC;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)      <u>Nature of the breach.</u> The nature of CPG’s breach, at its core, involved the inadequate monitoring by CPG of the procurement of AECs by Unimech. The evidence showed that CPG did exercise significant diligence in monitoring the timelines for the renewal of the certificates, reminding Unimech repeatedly to renew the certificate, and chasing for copies of the certificates. For example, CPG sent at least 11 emails between May 2014 to November 2014, and a further three more emails between February and March 2015, chasing for the AECs: see ASOF at [16] and [18]. Unlike Unimech, CPG was not told by Unimech, and <em>did not know for a fact</em> that there was no AEC, or that the Hoist was unsafe for use during the material period: see paragraph [24] above<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. That said, I found that CPG did, in the final analysis, breach its duties under section 11 WSHA by placing excessive reliance on Unimech, by failing to take independent, reasonably practicable steps to verify that the AECs were in fact issued when its suspicions ought to have been aroused by Unimech’s persistent failure to send over the AECs despite repeated promises. CPG also failed to shut down the Hoist when it could not say for sure that there was in fact a valid AEC in place, a statutory requirement under regulation 19 of the GP Regs.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_c"></a>(c)      <u>Seriousness of the breach.</u> In terms of the seriousness of the breach, CPG did not completely disregard the established procedures for ensuring that the AEC for the accident hoist was renewed. It did actively monitor and chase for the ACEs. On prior occasions where CPG was made aware that Unimech had difficulties in procuring an AE – such as during the AE Certification for the 20 October 2013 to 29 April 2014 period<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> - CPG had helped source for an AE for Unimech<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_d"></a>(d)      <u>Whether a systemic breach.</u> I did not think there was a systemic breach on CPG’s part. Admittedly, this was not a one-off incident. The evidence showed that Hoist failed to pass two rounds of AE certification during the material period. Two AECs covering the period from 30 Apr 2014 to 30 April 2015 ought to have been obtained, but were not. However, <em>two</em> cases do not establish a trend - failure by CPG to ensure that two rounds of AECs were obtained did not, in my mind, point to a systemic breach, especially when viewed against the backdrop of continuous misrepresentations and false assurances from Unimech.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Prosecution submitted that the breaches by CPG were in fact systemic, as there appeared to be other equipment besides the Hoist which did not have an AEC during the material period. Prosecution referred to the email of 6 February 2015 between Phyu and AE Chang Choong Meng at Exhibit P8 (Annex A), which Prosecution said showed that there was at least one other equipment that did not have a valid AEC arising from the inspection of 1 December 2014. I did not accept this submission. This line of questioning was never directly explored or put to CPG during the trial. The questions at trial focused almost exclusively on the Hoist; CPG was never asked, and hence never had the opportunity, to respond to questions concerning the state of certification of the other lift equipment at the premises. It would not be fair to allege systemic breaches involving other equipment when these lines of questioning were not directly pursued at trial.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_e"></a>(e)      <u>Whether intentional/rash/negligent.</u> The breach was negligent at its highest. CPG did not willfully disregard the regulations. The evidence showed that CPG was cognizant of the regulations; sought to abide by the regulations; actively monitored the timelines, reminded Unimech to procure renewal AECs ahead of their expiry dates, and followed up repeatedly for copies of the AECs. Ultimately, its efforts fell short of the standard required under law.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Based on the forgoing, I am of the view that CPG’s culpability should fall within the <u>Medium category (low end).</u> While the primary duty to procure the certificates laid with Unimech, as a specialist Managing Agent, CPG had a duty to monitor and ensure that the lifts and hoists at the workplace were covered by valid AECs before allowing them to continue in operation. While CPG did take various steps as part of its supervisory duties to ensure that the Hoist had a valid AEC, it could have done more, especially when its suspicions had been aroused. Had it done so, it would not have been misled by Unimech. I am therefore of the view that CPG’s culpability should be pegged at the Medium Category (low end).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Potential Harm</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Applying the factors relevant to the assessment of the level of potential harm as set out in [27] of MW Group, I would classify the potential harm caused by CPG’s breach under the <u>Medium category (mid end)</u> band:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)      <u>Seriousness of the harm risked.</u> I note that the activity undertaken by the worker in our case involved the manual loading and unloading of rubbish bins using a lift hoist. This is <em>not</em> an inherently dangerous activity, unlike the activities that featured in <em>MW Group, GSE</em> and <em>Mao Xuezhong</em>. However, the risk of workers being wedged between the hoist and the platform if the safety design of the hoist were compromised is a real one. Indeed, if the harm does materialize, the consequences can be very severe (with the potentiality of death). Regulation 19(3) GP Regs was enacted to specifically address risks of this nature, signifying the Ministry’s acknowledgment of the potential harm associated with the usage of such hoists. The requirement of periodic AE certifications by an independent Professional Engineer is intended to act as a second-layer check to ensure that compliance with safety rules and regulations are not left exclusively to the owner and its specialist contractors. Failure to ensure that AECs are in place therefore attracts definite risks.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>In assessing the seriousness of the harm risked, regard must, however, be had to the safety and/or mitigative measures that were put in place by CPG and/or Singtel to ensure the safe operation of the Hoist. These included: (i) the engagement of a <em>specialist</em> contractor (i.e. Unimech) to maintain and repair the hoist to ensure its safety for use, (ii) the imposition of a contractual duty on the specialist contractor (Unimech) to arrange for the requisite AE inspections and procure the AEC renewals; (iii) the existence of schedules for the servicing, maintenance and inspection of lifting equipment which Unimech is required to comply with<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>; (iv) CPG’s own efforts in monitoring the renewal of the AECs; and (v) the various safety measures put in place to ensure that the Hoist is being operated safely – e.g. safety signages to caution that no human passengers are allowed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>; the safety instructions in the “Method of Statement for Refuse Disposal” prepared by CSP dated 1 August 2013 (CSP Method Statement) <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>; and the provision safety a metal hook to the cleaners to allow them to reach for bins without entering the Hoist<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. Viewed in its totality, the seriousness of the harm risked is, in my opinion, moderate.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)      <u>Likelihood of the harm arising</u> <em>.</em> Harm in this context can arise from either (i) the delinquence on the part of the contractor (here Unimech) in procuring the AE inspection and AECs; and (ii) workers being injured whilst operating a hoist that has not been independently verified as safe due to their own negligence. All these are likely possibilities. Likelihood of delinquence on the part of the contractor in the present case was heightened by the fact that: (A) AECs were not received despite repeated chasers sent by CPG and promises by Unimech (which would have suggested to a reasonably prudent Managing Agent that something might be amiss); and (B) PW5’s (Mark Cruz) awareness that there were faulty safety devices which required rectification.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_c"></a>(c)      <u>Number of people exposed to the risk</u> <em><u>.</u></em> The <em>number of people exposed to the risk</em> is low as there is likely to be only one employee depositing or removing the bins from the lift at any one time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Based on the forgoing, I am of the view that the potential harm arising from CPG’s breach in the present case fell within the <u>Medium category (mid end)</u> band. This is commensurate with the potential harm in Unimech’s case which is pegged at Medium category (high end). Unlike CPG, <em>Unimech’s</em> breach included (i) allowing the hoist to continue in operation when it had <em>actual knowledge</em> that the lifts were not covered by a valid AEC, and (ii) it had <em>actual knowledge</em>, being the specialist contractors, that the limit switches were faulty which rendered the hoist unsafe for use. In contrast, CPG was not informed, and did not know for a fact, that there were no valid AECs in place. Neither did it know that the lift was unsafe for operations, having relied on the advice from Unimech: see paragraph 24 above. The seriousness of the harm risked in Unimech’s case is therefore higher. In view of these considerations, it is justified that the potential harm in the present case is pegged at a lower level compared to Unimech.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applying the Sentencing Framework</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Applying the sentencing table in <em>MW Group</em> [at 50], I would adopt an indicative starting sentencing point of $90,000 (between the low to mid-point of the Moderate-Harm and Moderate-Culpability Band).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I turn next to the aggravating and mitigating factors set out in <em>MW Group’s</em> case at [60] to [62]. Where death is caused or had a contributory link, this will be considered an aggravating factor. Following <em>MW Group</em>, as the accident involves a single death, I applied a $30,000 uplift<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. None of the other aggravating factors in [60] of <em>MW Group</em> applied. As for the mitigating factors cited by Defence at paragraphs [59] to [71] of their Mitigation Plea, these are not backed by any objective evidence. I therefore did not assign any weight to them. Overall, the net sentence would be a fine of $120,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Had I applied the <em>GSE</em> sentencing framework, I would have arrived at a similar outcome. Using the low to mid-point of the Moderate-Harm and Low-Culpability Band, under the <em>GSE</em> Framework, the indicative starting point would similarly be $90,000. As the <em>GSE</em> framework similarly only incorporates potential harm at the first stage, an uplift of $30,000 should be added by way of aggravating factor at the second stage given that the actual harm included the death of a worker. The net sentence would similarly be a fine of $120,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As noted in <em>Mao Xuezhong</em>, “sentencing guidelines are a means to an end, and the relevant end is the derivation of sentences that are just and are broadly consistent in cases that are broadly similar” (at [62]). A fine of $120,000 is, in my view, consistent with authority, and properly reflects the relative culpability of the CPG and Unimech. In contrast, the $300,000 sought by Prosecution would be wholly inconsistent with the parity principle. It subjects CPG to an unduly harsh punishment when Unimech is clearly the more culpable party.
