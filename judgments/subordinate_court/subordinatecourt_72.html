Teo Weng Kuan:</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       After pleading guilty to having provided a remote gambling service (to play poker online), the three offenders submitted that the custodial threshold had not been crossed for their offences. I disagreed, and now set out the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Mr Benjamin Ong Jia Wei, Ms Serene Chan Li Shan, and Mr Desmond Low Weimin started as poker punters in an online club on the “Pokerrrr2” mobile application. After incurring financial losses, they decided to set up their own online club on the same app to host their own poker games; they named it the “All In Poker Club”. Each of them then invited friends to join their club to play. Friends of those friends were also accepted. A WhatsApp chat group was then set up by them and used to notify club members of upcoming games, and to also update on the settlements after games were concluded. Games were then run regularly every two to three days after 6 pm with each taking turns to host. In general, Benjamin and Desmond supervised the games to prevent huge losses, while Serene updated the chat group and attended to the win/loss settlements using her POSB account. As hosts, they raked in 5% as tips from all bets placed at their club. This was regardless of the win/loss outcomes of the games. Club proceeds were shared equally amongst themselves. The club operated for 6 months from June to December 2018, when they finally decided to close the club down. In that time, club membership grew to 60-70 individuals; this figure included both active and non-active players. Subsequent police investigations into gambling rings which were using the “Pokerrr 2” app then led to their arrest.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       For the purposes of the prosecution, a slice of their club’s operations formed the focus of the charge, i.e. on 9th November 2018, 29 club members logged on and placed poker bets totalling $11,682/- at their club. A charge of having provided a remote gambling service which was not exempt on that date, under section 11(1) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (“RGA”) was then brought separately against each of them. All three admitted and pleaded guilty to their charge. All three entered their pleas before me on the same occasion, and all three admitted to the same set of amalgamated facts prepared by the prosecution (summarized above). All three were represented by the same counsel, and all three made the same submissions on sentence. These grounds accordingly cover all three offenders.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prescribed Penalty</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Section 11(1) of the RGA states that “Any person who provides a Singapore-based remote gambling service shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.”</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       All three offenders were untraced.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The prosecution sought “at least 3 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $20,000 for each”. This was pursuant to its reading and application of the sentencing framework laid down by the High Court in <em>Koo Kah Yee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25327-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 261</a> (“<em>Koo Kah Yee</em>”). The prosecution cited the policy considerations which called for stiff penalties for such offences, and that non-custodial sentences were only meant for cases where ‘the level of harm occasioned by the offence was slight and where culpability was low’; neither of which were the case for the offenders here.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation and Defence Submissions on Sentence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defence sought a non-custodial sentence and highlighted that this was not a criminal syndicate, and that all three individuals were actually decent regular folk (completely untraced) who were gainfully employed with respectable day jobs, and were simply persons who enjoyed the game of poker and who wanted to play it socially after office hours with their friends and acquaintances. Consistent with that, it was also highlighted that the 5% tips for the session on 9th November 2018 amounted to a “paltry $194” for each of them. It was also highlighted that the total bet quantum – whilst seemingly substantial at $11,682 – was not indicative of their total profits from that night’s session because club hosts did not always win due to the nature of the game of poker itself. The defence thus submitted that culpability and harm were both low, and that this was “precisely the sort of case in which a custodial sentence should not be warranted”.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Both parties agreed that the sentencing framework laid down in <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> was applicable. The first step in the framework was to identify the level of harm occasioned by the offence, followed by the offender’s culpability. In my judgment, the level of harm occasioned fell squarely within the slight range for the following reasons:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The total amount of bets involved in the charge stood at $11,682. This was just for one evening’s operations. Although no details were provided before me as to the number of games played and the total bets placed by each individual, the fact that there were 29 club members playing that night meant that the bets by each possibly came up to several hundred dollars. That is a substantial sum. In that regard, it bears noting – given the clear policy considerations and sentencing factors already recounted in <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> which this court would have to consider – that there was ultimately no evidence placed before me that any of the offenders took any steps whatsoever to address the potential for harm as a result of them peddling this vice through the internet direct to the personal devices of these punters, and goading them to join in the activities of their provocatively named “All In Poker Club”. Nothing was said before me about these three having even been concerned about that aspect, or of them having made any efforts at all to check that their club members could even afford to wager and lose the hefty sums which they were placing at their club, or of them having attended to the possible ripple effects in terms of cost to those persons, their families, and jobs (if any) from that gambling. The claim that the club was restricted to friends and acquaintances, must therefore be seen in that light. This was not an informal and <em>adhoc</em> gathering of a small close-knit group of poker enthusiasts who indulged socially and who knew each other well and who could be counted on to watch out for each other to ensure that their occasional flutter did not get out of hand. Rather, the facts showed that this was a well organised illicit poker ring which had grown well past that, and which was concerned primarily with getting the game on; credit for that being due to the efforts of these three who actively promoted their club to their friends, and accepted in others to play as well – the only apparent criteria being: as long as they were recommended and were “friends of those friends”. In as much as that may have had any connection to a desire to limit harm (which was not the explicit position adopted before me), it had plainly all the more direct connection to ensuring that operations remained discreet and collections remaining reliable.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     In coming to the assessment on the level of harm occasioned, I should make clear that I did not strictly have regard to the fact that the club operated regularly with games being organized every other day or so for 6 months in total, or that club members actually totalled 60-70 individuals. Though these aspects formed the undisputed background to the offence, they did not come within the ambit of the prosecution’s proceeded charge. If they were considered directly, they would no doubt have moved the assessment significantly further up the scale from where I had pegged it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Next, in respect of culpability, it was the common position taken by the parties before me that all three were equally culpable for the offence. After considering the role played by them, I was satisfied that the three offenders all fell squarely within the high culpability band. The facts showed that all three performed critically central roles. The club was conceived by them, the recruitment of members was done by them, the games were promulgated and organized by them, the wagers were tracked by them, the game proceeds were settled by them, and the club’s takings were shared amongst themselves exclusively. In short, these three not only masterminded the club, they went on to each play pivotal roles in its operations – which were in themselves sophisticated, deliberate, and sustained. The entire operation was also clearly premeditated since all three admitted that they had set up their own poker club on the app to play as hosts after they had incurred losses as individual punters whilst playing with various other hosts of poker clubs already on the app. The defence may submit that the level of sophistication should not be overplayed because such online poker clubs can be easily set up on the app in a matter of clicks. That would be correct, but that submission conveniently ignores the deliberate thought process and sustained series of actions which are required to understand the framework on offer in the app, and how to organize it and maximize it for their own benefit. That same submission also conveniently highlights how the ease of such offending needs to be appropriately catered for.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     With harm and culpability thus determined, the indicative sentencing range as laid down in <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> was resultingly 1 to 2½ years’ imprisonment plus a disgorgement fine [83] and [84]. The appropriate sentence in each case had to be nonetheless determined with reference to the specific facts. In that regard, I accepted the defence contention that all three individuals were actually “decent regular folks (completely untraced) who were gainfully employed with respectable day jobs, and were simply persons who enjoyed the game of poker” – but who clearly wanted to do so at odds which were more favourable to themselves. I acknowledged therefore that the three offenders did not embark on this venture as part of a criminal syndicate, and there was no evidence before me that they had executed all this in order to fund some other illicit activities. Additionally, I considered the fact that all three offenders took the initiative to cease their club’s operations on their own after being belatedly concerned over its legality. All three were also taking full responsibility for their actions by pleading guilty at an early stage. As a result, the need for specific deterrence was thus not only not activated, I determined that it was appropriate to grant further concessions to them on the sentence on those counts and peg the sentence at the bottom of that range.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I now turn to a more granular assessment of the level of harm occasioned. I had earlier alluded to the defence posture as it was adopted before me as regards how concerned each was (or was not) as to the consequence of their peddling this vice to that many “friends and acquaintances” and allowing those hefty bets. That was relevant to the assessment of the potential harm. The point being made there is that such offences are not victimless offences, and that underscores the important policy considerations behind the RGA. Just because all the punters were seemingly there of their own free will, it would be wrong to think that no harm was being occasioned. However, in terms of the actual harm occasioned, this had to be considered in the context of the charge which referenced only one evening’s operations. Given that it was undisputed before me that the three of them carried on the club’s operations for a much longer period of 6 months, the prosecution could have presumably brought more charges, or framed it more widely, but did not. At the same time, it was also evident from the facts that the investigations were wide ranging, but no evidence was ultimately placed before me as to any actual harm occasioned, or of the scale of total benefits which each derived from the venture (as opposed to just the 5% tips raked in that night). The prosecution’s submission in this context for “at least 3 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $20,000 for each” when the <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> sentencing framework indicated a range of 1 to 2½ years’ imprisonment plus disgorgement fine therefore gained more significance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the final analysis, it is not uncommon for decent regular folk to fall into vice and commit such offences. Ms Koo Kah Yee herself was a case in point. Even in her case, there was a limit to how much mileage that argument could sway the sentence. Sentencing in this area remains determined by the important policy considerations behind the RGA which makes general deterrence the predominant consideration. The defence submitted that those who organise themselves in this way and who have reaped a measure of financial reward should be allowed to get away with a fine. I could not agree; especially since the sentencing framework in <em>Koo Kah Yee</em> made it clear that nothing less than an imprisonment term plus a disgorgement fine was to be expected. Having considered the facts and the sentencing positions of the parties as it was presented before me, I determined that 3 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $20,000 in default 2 months’ imprisonment was appropriate and so ordered for each of them. The three offenders have since filed an appeal against the sentence, which has been stayed pending the appeal.</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap10 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
