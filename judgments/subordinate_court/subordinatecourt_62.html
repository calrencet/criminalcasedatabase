guilty to a single charge under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241, 1993 Rev Ed.) (“PCA”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Sometime between 2011 and 2012, in Singapore, being an agent, namely, a Project Manager employed by H P Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd (“HPC”) corruptly obtained from one Lam Chat (“Lam”), an ex-Project Director of Xin Long (S) Pte Ltd (“XLPL”), a gratification of $1,000 as a reward for revealing HPC’s budget to XLPL in relation to the Home for the Aged Sick Project,</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The accused admitted to Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. The SOF is set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><em>“A</em></b>      <b><em>INTRODUCTION</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>1</em>.     <em>The accused is </em> <b><em>Tan Yih Wei</em></b>, <em>Male / 51 years old, bearing NRIC no. XXX, Malaysian national. He resides at Block 722, Yishun Street 71, #XXX, Singapore. At the material time, the accused was employed as a Project Manager by H P Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd (“</em><b><em>HPC</em></b><em>”).</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>2</em>.     <em>HPC is a construction company in the business of performing main contracts for construction works.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>3</em>.     <em>The giver is one </em> <b><em>Lam Chat</em></b> <em>, Male / 55 years old, Singapore citizen (“</em> <b><em>Lam</em></b> <em>”). Lam is also known as Alan. At the material time, Lam was employed as a Project Director by Xin Long (S) Pte Ltd (“</em> <b><em>XLPL</em></b> <em>”), which is located at 10 Ubi Cres, #06-69, Ubi Techpark, Singapore.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>4</em>.     <em>XLPL is a company in the construction business, particularly in the fabrication of, inter alia, metal doors, grilles, gratings, and other steel products.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><em>B</em></b>      <b><em>FACTS PERTAINING TO THE PROCEEDED CHARGE UNDER SECTION 6(A) OF THE PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION ACT (CAP 241) (“PCA”)</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>5</em>.     <em>The accused is acquainted with Lam, having worked with him on construction projects in the past. Prior to September to October 2011, the accused and Lam had a corrupt agreement that Lam would pay the accused some money in return for the accused’s assistance in securing projects for XLPL with HPC.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>6</em>.     <em>During the course of 2011, the accused racked up gambling debts of around S$10,000. As a result, he owed money to several licensed moneylenders.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>7</em>.     <em>Sometime in September to October 2011, the accused called Lam and told Lam that HPC had a project to upgrade a nursing home, the Society for the Aged Sick (“</em> <b><em>SFAS</em></b> <em>”). HPC was looking for a subcontractor to perform the metalworks portion of that project. The accused informed Lam that all other subcontractors had submitted quotations containing prices that were too high, and that if Lam submitted a quotation slightly below HPC’s budget, Lam would almost certainly get the job.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>8</em>.     <em>Thereafter, sometime in October to November 2011, whilst Lam was preparing XLPL’s quotation to HPC, the accused called Lam again and disclosed HPC’s budget of S$120,000 to Lam. The accused added that all other subcontractors had quoted a sum higher than S$120,000, so if Lam submitted a bid close to that amount, Lam would very likely win the bid.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>9</em>.     <em>Lam subsequently submitted a quotation on XLPL’s behalf to HPC that was lower than HPC’s budget. XLPL won the bid for the said SFAS subcontract. The subcontract between XLPL and HPC was signed on 28 November 2011.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>10</em>.     <em>Subsequently, the accused contacted Lam and asked him to “cover” his gambling debts in the sum of S$3,000 in return for revealing HPC’s budget to XLPL (see [7] to [8] above). Lam eventually negotiated the amount to a lower one of S$1,000.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>11</em>.     <em>Thereafter, sometime in early 2012, the accused met up with Lam at a coffeeshop. There, Lam handed the accused a red packet containing S$1,000 in cash. The accused knew that these monies comprised the bribe from Lam in return for his act of disclosing HPC’s budget for the SFAS subcontract to Lam. The accused admitted that he had basically told Lam how much to quote in order that XLPL would win the SFAS project, which allowed XLPL an unfair advantage in the bidding process.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>12</em>.     <em>The accused knew at all times that it was not appropriate for him to be asking Lam for money in return for helping XLPL win the SFAS project with HPC. Additionally, the accused knew at all times that his superiors at HPC did not allow him to reveal HPC’s budget for the SFAS project to Lam/XLPL. Knowing this, the accused deliberately did not tell his superiors that he had received money from Lam.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>13</em>.     <em>To date, the accused did not return any portion of the S$1,000 bribe to Lam.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>14</em>.     <em>By virtue of the foregoing facts, the accused, an agent of HPC, corruptly obtained gratification of S$1,000 from Lam as a reward for revealing HPC’s budget in relation to the SFAS subcontract to Lam, and has thereby committed an offence punishable under s. 6(a) PCA.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b><em>C</em></b>      <b><em>CONCLUSION</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>15. The accused admits to committing the above offence and stands charged accordingly.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The accused has no antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submissions on sentence / plea in mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submission on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold in the present case had been crossed. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17267-SSP.xml')">[2015] SGHC 117</a> (<em>“Romel”)</em>, the High Court set categorized the various types of private corruption cases. This particular case fell within <em>Category 2</em> and in <em>Romel</em> at [28], the Chief Justice held that such cases, “<em>frequently attract custodial terms”</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Prosecution therefore sought a sentence of at least two weeks’ imprisonment, together with the requisite penalty of $1,000 under s 13 of the PCA. The Prosecution explained why this case was a <em>Romel category 2</em> case:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The accused, the receiver, was the one who initiated and asked for the bribe of S$1,000 from the giver Lam, and not the other way around;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The accused did compromise his principal’s interests; he eventually revealed HPC’s budget for the SFAS project to Lam in return for S$1,000, the very thing the accused was duty-bound not to do;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     The giver, Lam, received a custodial sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment for his mirror offence of under s 6(b) of the PCA in corruptly giving gratification to the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Prosecution submitted that their sentencing position of two weeks’ imprisonment was further supported by <em>Romel 2</em> decisions involving similar amounts:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)      <em>PP v Muthukaruppan Periyasamy</em> (DAC-901741-2019 &amp; Ors)</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused pleaded guilty to two charges under s 6(b) of the PCA (total sum: $800). Three similar charges being TIC for the purposes of sentencing (total sum: $800). The accused was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment per charge. Both sentences were to run concurrently.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused was a manager at a construction site promised $400 per month each to two co-accused, employed by a pest-control company contracted by the National Environment Agency (“NEA”), to notifying him of any upcoming NEA mosquito breeding inspections. They gave the accused two separate advance warnings of NEA inspections. Because of this advance notice, the accused managed to perform the necessary housekeeping before the NEA team arrived, resulting in no violations found by the NEA Team when they inspected the site.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)      <em>PP v Md Rajib Hossan Nor Mohammad</em> (DAC-905211-2017 &amp; Ors)</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused pleaded guilty to two charges under s 6(a) of the PCA (total sum: $200). Two similar charges being TIC for the purposes of sentencing (total sum: $100). The accused was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment per charge. Both sentences were to run concurrently.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused worked for a company that provided cleaning services to Ang Mo Kio (“AMK”) Town Council (“TC”). His responsibilities included managing the cleaning operations of AMK. The co-accused, who was not a resident of AMK offered him “coffee money” in return for allowing him to dispose rubbish in the bin centre under his charge.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)      <em>PP v Sanowar Hossain Jiab Uddin</em> (DAC-941284-2015 &amp; Ors)</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 6(a) ($200) and another charge under s 28(a) of the PCA. Two additional charges under s 28(a) of the PCA were TIC for the purposes of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused was a foreman for a company that provided cleaning services to Sembawang (“SB”) Town Council (“TC”) including Marsiling. His responsibilities included managing the cleaning operations of SB. He sought $200 from one Ng, who was not living in SB, to help clear debris. If the money was paid, the accused would have asked his workers to dispose debris the company’s skip tank</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plea in mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Defence agreed that <em>Romel</em> should apply in the present case. However, they categorized the case as a <em>Romel Category 1</em>. Hence it was submitted that a fine was the appropriate sentence. The reasons for this categorization are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     The accused was not in a position of trust or influence. He was only involved in works such as managing manpower needs, arranging deliveries and ensuring that works were completed on time;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     The accused was not “duty bound” to inspect the deficiencies in the services provided by XLPL. He was also was not in a position of authority to decide on works, to value the budget for such works or to decide who to award the sub-contract. These were done without the accused’s involvement by HPC’s managing director and quantity surveyor;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     The information provided by the accused to XLPL gave XLPL minimal benefit;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     That although the other contractors who had bided for the project were disadvantaged, from the perspective of HPC, XLPL and even SAFS. It was submitted that HPC and SFAS in fact benefitted as the project was completed timeously and within budget.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Defence referred to several precedents showing that fines were imposed for similar cases. These were as follows</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)      <em>Heng Tze Yong v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21235-SSP.xml')">[2017] 5 SLR 976</a></p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 6(b) of the PCA involving $7,000. A similar charge was TIC for the purpose of sentencing. The accused was sentenced to five weeks’ imprisonment. On appeal, the sentence of imprisonment was set aside, and the accused was fined $35,000 instead.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused was the director of ANM, a company providing semi-conductor engineering service. Micron Semi-Conductors (“Micron”) had awarded ANM several contracts. During a meeting with the facility manager of Micron, the accused understood that he was asking for money in return for giving ANM business from Micron. The accused therefore decided to give money to him to maintain a good business relationship in order that ANM would, with his assistance, secure business from Micron.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)      <em>PP v Mohamed Malik Seeni Syed and Anor</em> (DAC 905627-2019 &amp; Ors)</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused pleaded guilty to two charges under s 6(b) of the PCA involving $1,800. Two similar charges (involving $1800) were TIC for the purpose of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>The accused was a director of a company, Via Star, selling watches, including to the company which employed the co-accused. In return for cash paid by the accused, the co-accused would push the sale of watches supplied by Via Star to customers. This would allow Via Star to clear its inventory of watches such that it would not incur the extra cost of shipping excess inventory back to its suppliers in Dubai.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Punishment Prescribed by Law</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The punishment prescribed by law for an offence under s 6(a) of the PCA provides that upon conviction, a person shall be liable with imprisonment for up to five years, or with fine of up to $100,000, or with both.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Considerations</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing considerations in corruption cases</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In Singapore, it is established law that the main sentencing considerations in corruption cases are deterrence and punishment and deterrence is <em>always</em> a relevant sentencing consideration: <em>PP v Ang Seng Thor</em> [2011] 4 SLR 21 (“<em>Ang Seng Thor</em>”) at [33].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Courts have also made it abundantly clear that there is no presumption in favour of a non-custodial sentence where private sector corruption is concerned: per <em>Romel</em> at [26]. In <em>Takaaki Masui v PP and another appeal and other matters</em> [2020] SGHC] 265 (“<em>Masui</em>”) at [79(c)], the High Court again held that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">     <em>“ … while there is no norm in favour of non-custodial sentences in private sector corruption cases, the general trend indicates that where private sector agents performing purely commercial functions are concerned, offences which register a lower level of overall criminal culpability may be dealt with through the imposition of fines. However, our courts have repeatedly stressed that whether or not the custody threshold is breached will depend greatly on the “specific nature of corruption” [emphasis in original] that presents itself on the facts (see Romel at [20] ….”.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Romel</em>, Sunderesh Menon CJ proceeded to classify private sector corruption generally into the three broad and non-exhaustive categories (<em>Romel</em> at [26]–[31]). They are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)      <em>Romel category 1</em>. This is where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest. An example of this can be seen in <em>Ang Seng Thor</em> where the receiving parties were paid to purchase the goods of the paying party. Whether the custodial threshold is crossed would depend on the facts of the case (at [26(a)] and [27]);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)      <em>Romel category 2</em>. This is where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This is also typically done at the payer’s behest. These cases will frequently attract custodial sentences (at [26(b)] and [28]);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)      <em>Romel category 3</em>. This is where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the receiving party’s behest. A custodial term will generally be the norm for such cases (at [26(c)], [29]–[30]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Classifying the present case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Defence had classified this as a <em>Romel category 1.</em> It was submitted that the accused was not in a position of power, influence or trust and that the information gave XLPL minimal benefit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the other hand, the Prosecution had classified this as a <em>Romel category 2</em> case. As explained, the accused with duty bound <em>not</em> to reveal his principal, ie. HPC’s budget, for the SFAS project to Lam for $1,000. If the accused revealed his company’s budget, the entire bidding process would become moot as this bidder, ie Lam / XLPL would have an unfair advantage. In this case, the information was used to ultimately win the bid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I disagreed with the Defence’s classification of this case. Although a person’s position of power, influence or trust may be an important factor in determining the classification of the corrupt act in <em>Romel</em>, it is but one factor that would be considered by the court. The nature of the information that a person has provided may (or may not) be just as, or more significant or important. In most cases, it is the position of an accused within a company that allows him to come into possession of such significant or important information, thought this is not always the case. Even if, as suggested by the Defence, that the accused had no say in the actual bidding process, this was a non-issue.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In my view, what the accused did in this case fitted the description of a <em>Romel category 2</em> case. It is neither here nor there that that HPC and SFAS in fact benefitted as the project was completed timeously and within budget. The whole point of not revealing the budget is to allow the open bidding for all interested parties in order to allow the principal, in this case HPC, to obtain the best value for money. The fact that the accused did not have any power, influence or trust within the company was also neither here nor there. The information he gave Lam for gratification, was significant and could affect HPC adversely. He informed Lam that the other interested parties had made bids higher than HPC’s $120,000 budget.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Furthermore, I do not think that it is accurate to say that XLPL obtained minimal benefit from the information obtained. The information given by the accused to Lam allowed XLPL to know not only what HPC’s budget was, but also what bids had been made by the other interested bidders,</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     All considered, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that this was a <em>Romel category 2</em> case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Having accepted that this was a <em>Romel category 2</em> case, the next issue would be determining the appropriate sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It bears repeating that the High Court has held that a <em>Romel category 2</em> case will <em>“frequently attract custodial sentences”.</em> In fact, the Defence had conceded that if this was a <em>Romel category 2</em> case, the sentence imposed by the court would typically be a custodial term.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As highlighted by the Prosecution, the were offence specific aggravating factors that warranted a custodial term. Although the accused and Lam already had a corrupt agreement that Lam would pay the accused some money in return for the accused’s assistance in securing projects for XLPL with HPC, in this particular instant, it was the accused who had initiated the request and asked Lam to “cover” his gambling debts in the sum of $3,000 in return for revealing the information.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> This amount would be eventually reduced to $1,000. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that this was an aggravating factor. I was of custody threshold was crossed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In submitting for a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment, the Prosecution had highlighted that in the mirror charge faced by Lam, Lam had been sentenced of two weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution had also highlighted the three precedent cases to support their submission.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In comparing this case with the precedent cases tendered by the Prosecution, I was of the opinion that the culpability of the accused was less the accused persons in those cases. For example, the accused persons in the precedents cited by the Prosecution faced more than one charge. In the present case, the accused faced a single charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With respect to the mirror charge, I was of the view that that Lam’s sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment should be looked at closely. First, Lam faced 16 charges, nine being PCA charges whilst seven were under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). In my view, this could have affected how Lam was sentenced. For example, the three PCA charges were proceeded with. This involved Lam giving corrupt gratification to one Ng Han Ting (“Ng”), one Chua Kah Seng (“Chua”) and the accused in the present case. Chua was administered a conditional stern warning while the charges against Ng were proceeded with.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>PP v Ng Han Ting</em> (DAC-927849-2019 &amp; Ors), Ng faced three charges for corruptly receiving gratification from Lam. Two charged were proceeded with (amounts were $2,000 and $1,000 respectively). The Prosecution had assessed this case to be a <em>Romel category 1</em>. The accused was fined $6,000 and $4,000 respectively, in addition to the penalty imposed. Meanwhile, in the mirror charge, Lam was sentenced to five weeks’ imprisonment <em>vide</em> DAC-932205-2019.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Hence, I assessed that the starting point in this case to be less than two weeks’ imprisonment as submitted by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I next took into account the mitigating factors present. In particular, I noted that the accused was a first offender and that he was remorseful for what he did. This remorse can be further seen by his plea of guilt. Accordingly, I assessed the appropriate final sentence to be one weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentence Imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In summary, having considered all the facts of the case, I was of the view that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     This was a <em>Romel category 2</em> case;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     The custody threshold had been crossed;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     The appropriate sentence was one weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, has appealed against it. The sentence of imprisonment has been stayed and the accused is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence (“NE”), 9 February 2021, 3/6-15.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>NE, 19 Feb 2021, 15/14-17.</p> <p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Statement of Facts at [10].</p> </div> </content> </root> </maincontent> </div> <form action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&amp;_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1" name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap10 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner"> <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
